3. **MAS‑CDD‑05** – The client risk profile is marked as ""High"" while the system applies simplified CDD (edd_required = false). Simplified CDD is only permissible for low‑risk customers, so this is a direct rule breach.
4. **MAS‑CDD‑03 / MAS‑CDD‑04** – Although the customer is not a PEP and the jurisdictions (Thailand, China) are not FATF high‑risk, the high client risk rating and the large transaction amount still trigger enhanced due diligence under MAS‑CDD‑01.
5. **MAS‑WIRE‑01 / MAS‑WIRE‑02** – The originator and beneficiary details are present, so wire‑transfer compliance is met, but the lack of up‑to‑date KYC and missing beneficial owner information elevate the risk.
6. **MAS‑STR‑01** – No STR has been filed yet, but the red flags (large amount, overdue KYC, missing beneficial owner, high risk profile) strongly suggest that an STR should be considered.

1. **MAS‑WIRE‑01 & MAS‑WIRE‑02** – The SWIFT message lacks full originator and beneficiary details (no address or ID number). This omission violates the requirement for complete originator/beneficiary information and triggers the mandatory investigation/rejection pathway. 
2. **MAS‑CDD‑01** – Although the amount (≈SGD 5,000) is below the S20,000 threshold, the transfer is cross‑border (JP→VN) and exceeds the S1,500 threshold for wire transfers, mandating full CDD. The customer’s KYC record is incomplete (missing address) and the transaction is flagged as high risk. 
3. **MAS‑CDD‑03** – The customer is a PEP and the EDD has been performed, but the documentation still shows gaps (missing address, no ID number). 
4. **MAS‑STR‑01** – Sanctions screening returned a “potential” hit. Under MAS, any potential sanctions or suspicious activity should prompt an STR filing. No STR has been filed yet, increasing the risk profile. 
5. **Overall risk profile** – The customer is rated high risk, the transaction is cross‑border, and the originator/beneficiary details are incomplete. These factors collectively place the transaction in the 66‑85% risk band, corresponding to a high‑risk score of 75.",0.028715383,0,

- **MAS-CDD-02**: The customer is a corporate entity, so the bank must identify and verify the beneficial owners. No beneficial‑owner information is provided, violating the requirement for legal persons.
- **MAS-STR-01**: Sanctions screening returned a ""potential"" hit. Under MAS, any transaction that raises a sanctions concern must trigger an STR. No STR has been filed.
- **MAS-CDD-05**: Although the customer is rated low risk, the transaction exceeds the S20,000 threshold, so simplified CDD is not permissible; full CDD is mandatory.
- **Purpose & Narrative**: The purpose code (EDU) and narrative are vague, and the swift_f70_purpose field contains a nonsensical string, raising concerns about the economic rationale of the transfer.

- **MAS-CDD-02**: Beneficial owners of the legal person are not identified or documented, violating the requirement to verify ultimate beneficial owners for non‑exempt legal persons.
- **MAS-WIRE-01**: The wire transfer message lacks full originator and beneficiary details (no address or ID number, BICs are null). The travel rule is incomplete, and the swift F50/F59 fields are present but insufficient.
- **MAS-WIRE-02**: Because of the missing information, the transfer should be investigated or suspended, and an STR should be filed if suspicious.
- **MAS-STR-01**: Sanctions screening shows a ""potential"" hit, and no STR has been filed yet. The combination of a high‑value transfer, high‑risk customer, and sanctions concern triggers an STR requirement.
- **MAS-MON-01**: The transaction is large and complex, and ongoing monitoring is required; the lack of documented monitoring plans for this transaction adds to the risk.
