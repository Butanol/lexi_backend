1. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The risk analysis must cover client domicile and sanctions exposure. The originator is from Vietnam, a jurisdiction that is typically classified as higher risk, and the sanctions screening result is ""potential"". This indicates a possible sanctions violation that should be flagged in the risk analysis.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – Key risk indicators for high‑risk jurisdictions and client segments must be monitored. The presence of a potential sanctions flag and the cross‑border nature of the transfer (originator in VN, beneficiary in CH) would push the transaction toward the high‑risk KRI thresholds. Although the customer risk rating is low and EDD was performed, the potential sanctions exposure still elevates the risk.

3. **Narrative and purpose code** – The narrative is nonsensical and the swift F70 purpose field contains an unrelated statement. While not a direct rule violation, such anomalies are typical indicators of suspicious activity and increase the overall risk assessment.

4. **Compliance controls** – The transaction meets most documentation requirements (SWIFT F50/F59 present, travel rule complete, EDD performed, SOW documented). However, the potential sanctions flag is not fully resolved in the provided data, leaving a gap that could trigger an exception or additional monitoring.

Given these factors, the transaction falls into the **Medium Risk** band (46‑65).

1. **High‑risk jurisdiction** – The originator is from Iran (IR), a country on the HKMA/SFC sanctions list.  Under **HKMA‑R‑010** and **AML‑SUS‑04** any transaction involving a high‑risk jurisdiction must trigger enhanced due diligence (EDD) and a suspicious transaction report (STR).  Although EDD was performed, the potential sanctions match was not escalated or reported, constituting a regulatory breach.

2. **Sanctions screening flagged as “potential”** – The sanctions check returned a potential match.  According to **MAS‑VA‑06** and **AML‑SUS‑04**, a potential sanctions match requires immediate investigation and STR filing.  The absence of an STR (str_filed_datetime is null) is a clear violation.

3. **Out‑of‑date KYC** – The customer’s last KYC was completed on 10/11/2020 and was due on 10/11/2022.  Under **AML‑CDD‑01** and **HKMA‑R‑009** all customers must have current CDD records before any transaction.  The overdue KYC represents a compliance gap.

4. **High daily cash exposure** – The customer’s daily cash total is HK$30,585.96 with 5 transactions, well above the HK$8,000 threshold for high‑value cash movements.  **AML‑SUS‑04** requires investigation of structuring or rapid movement of funds, which is not documented.

5. **Missing STR** – No STR was filed despite the transaction involving a high‑risk jurisdiction, a potential sanctions match, and a high daily cash volume.  This omission violates **AML‑SUS‑04** and **MAS‑VA‑06**.

6. **Potential EDD requirement** – While EDD was performed, the transaction still falls under the high‑risk jurisdiction rule, and the institution should have documented the EDD findings and the rationale for proceeding.

The absence of documented beneficial owner details is a red flag.

2. **MAS‑CDD‑04** – Both originator and beneficiary are from Russia, a jurisdiction flagged by FATF for inadequate AML/CFT measures.  This elevates the transaction to high‑risk status and mandates EDD.  While EDD is reported as performed, the lack of evidence of source‑of‑funds verification for a high‑risk jurisdiction remains a concern.

3. **MAS‑STR‑01** – Sanctions screening returned a ""potential"" hit.  Under MAS, any transaction with a potential sanctions or adverse media hit must be investigated and, if suspicious, an STR filed.  No STR has been filed yet, indicating a compliance gap.

4. **MAS‑WIRE‑01 / MAS‑WIRE‑02** – The transaction is a cross‑border transfer (FPS to a Russian account).  Full originator and beneficiary details are present, but BICs are missing.  While not a direct violation, the incomplete wire‑transfer metadata could trigger a review under MAS‑WIRE‑02.

The required originator/beneficiary details are incomplete: no ID numbers are supplied, and the swift_f50/f59 fields are present but the full identification data is missing. MAS‑WIRE‑02 mandates investigation or suspension when such information is lacking, and an STR may be required.

2. **MAS‑CDD‑04** – The beneficiary resides in Iran, a FATF‑listed high‑risk jurisdiction. MAS‑CDD‑04 requires EDD for any customer or beneficial owner from a high‑risk jurisdiction. The transaction shows no evidence of EDD being performed for the beneficiary, and the customer’s beneficial owner details are not provided.

3. **MAS‑CDD‑02** – As a corporate customer, the bank must identify and verify the beneficial owners of the legal person. No beneficial owner information is present, creating a compliance gap.

4. **MAS‑CDD‑01** – Although the amount (SGD 5,562.81) is below the S20,000 threshold, the transaction is a non‑account, cross‑border wire, which still requires full CDD. The KYC record shows the last completion date as 25/04/2024, but the cash deposit channel requires ID verification at the time of the transaction, which is missing (cash_id_verified = false).

5. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", indicating a possible sanctions hit due to the beneficiary’s Iranian nationality. MAS‑STR‑01 requires a prompt STR for any suspicious transaction, and the absence of an STR filing (str_filed_datetime = null) is a red flag.

6. **Missing source‑of‑funds/wealth documentation** – The transaction lacks documentation of the source of funds or source of wealth, which is required for EDD under MAS‑CDD‑01 and MAS‑CDD‑03 if a PEP or high‑risk customer is involved.

These combined gaps and potential violations place the transaction in the **High‑Risk** category (66‑85) but close to **Very High Risk** due to the sanctions exposure and missing EDD for a high‑risk jurisdiction. Hence a risk score of 88 is assigned.

The required CDD (including source of funds and purpose) has not been updated, and the transaction exceeds the HK$8,000 threshold, so CDD is mandatory.  The absence of a current KYC record and the lack of a documented Statement of Work (sow_documented = false) represent a clear breach.

2. **HKMA‑R‑010 / MAS‑EDD‑01** – EDD is mandatory for PEPs and high‑risk customers.  The transaction is 96,390 CHF (≈HK$800,000) and the customer is a PEP; yet EDD has not been performed (edd_performed = false).  This is a direct violation of the EDD requirement.

3. **MAS‑WIRE‑01** – For wire transfers above HK$8,000, the institution must collect and record originator and beneficiary details.  While swift_f50_present and swift_f59_present are true, the originator is a PEP and the EDD requirement is unmet, so the transfer is still non‑compliant.

4. **AML‑SUS‑04** – The transaction is high‑value, involves a PEP, and is a complex fund subscription.  The lack of EDD and overdue KYC means the transaction should have been flagged and investigated, but no STR has been filed (str_filed_datetime = null).

5. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", indicating that the customer or counterparties may appear on sanctions lists.  Combined with the PEP status and high value, this elevates the risk.

6. **Missing beneficial owner information** – The customer is a domiciliary company (HKMA‑R‑008).  No beneficial ownership details are provided, which is a regulatory gap for a high‑risk entity.

Given the multiple rule violations (overdue KYC, missing EDD, potential sanctions, PEP status, high‑value transaction, and lack of STR filing), the transaction falls into the **Very High Risk** category, warranting a score of 90 on the 0‑100 scale.  The score reflects the cumulative impact of the identified red flags and the severity of the regulatory breaches.

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The bank’s risk analysis must cover client domicile, segment, product, and geography. This transaction involves a cross‑border FX conversion between an Indonesian originator and a Hong Kong beneficiary, both considered moderate‑risk jurisdictions. The presence of a large amount (≈2.9 M SGD) and the fact that the originator’s KYC is overdue (due date 15/5/2023, last completed 16/11/2022) raise the inherent risk score for the client segment and geography categories.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – Key risk indicators (KRIs) for high‑risk client segments and jurisdictions would likely flag this transaction because the client’s KYC is overdue and the transaction amount exceeds typical thresholds for a medium‑risk individual. The KRI dashboard would show a breach of the tolerance limit for “high‑risk client exposure” and “large cross‑border FX volume.” Since a KRI breach triggers EDD, the fact that EDD was performed (even though the system marked it as not required) indicates a remedial action was taken.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – The transaction does not appear to have required an exception approval, but the presence of a potential sanctions match (screening result “potential”) and the large amount would normally trigger an exception request with an EDD plan. The absence of an explicit exception request form or board approval is a minor documentation gap.

4. **FINMA‑RISK‑04** – The transaction is within the annual review cycle, but the overdue KYC and potential sanctions match suggest that the risk analysis may need updating. The lack of a recent KYC update is a compliance gap.

5. **FINMA‑RISK‑05** – As a cross‑border transaction involving foreign jurisdictions, it falls under the consolidated risk analysis scope. The potential sanctions match and large volume would trigger a consolidated KRI alert, but no group‑level exception or EDD plan is documented.

Overall, the transaction exhibits moderate risk due to the combination of a large cross‑border FX amount, overdue KYC, and a potential sanctions match. The risk score of 55 reflects a medium‑risk level (70–85% threshold) with some minor documentation gaps but no outright rule violations. The score is below the high‑risk threshold (66–85) because the bank performed EDD and the transaction does not involve a PEP or a high‑risk jurisdiction.

The transaction record indicates ""edd_required"": false, yet ""edd_performed"": true, which is inconsistent and suggests that the required EDD was not properly documented or justified.

2. **KYC overdue (FINMA‑RISK‑01 & FINMA‑RISK‑02)** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 31/10/2020 and was due on 31/10/2022, meaning the KYC is now two years overdue. This violates the requirement to maintain up‑to‑date KYC data for all clients, especially those in high‑risk jurisdictions.

3. **Product complexity (FINMA‑RISK‑01)** – The transaction is a ""securities_trade"" with a complex product flag set to true. High‑risk products require additional scrutiny and EDD when combined with high‑risk jurisdictions.

4. **Missing or inconsistent data (FINMA‑RISK‑01)** – The transaction uses a cheque channel but includes Swift F50 and F59 messages, which is contradictory. No BICs are provided for either the ordering or beneficiary institution, and the swift_f50_present flag is true. This inconsistency raises concerns about the integrity of the transaction data.

5. **Potential sanctions exposure (FINMA‑RISK‑01)** – The beneficiary country (Iran) is subject to extensive sanctions. Although the sanctions screening result is ""none"", the presence of a high‑risk jurisdiction alone warrants a thorough sanctions check and EDD.

6. **Travel rule compliance (FINMA‑RISK‑01)** – While the travel rule is marked as complete, the lack of BICs and the use of a cheque channel undermine the reliability of the travel rule compliance.

Given these multiple violations and red flags, the transaction falls into the ""Very High Risk"" category (86‑100). The risk score of 90 reflects the severity of the inconsistencies, the high‑risk jurisdiction exposure, and the failure to meet the documented EDD and KYC requirements.

1. **MAS-WIRE-01** – The transfer exceeds HK$8,000, so the institution must record the originator’s account number, address, and identification details, and the beneficiary’s account number and address.  The record shows only the account numbers and names; the originator address, ID number, and beneficiary address are missing, and the required SWIFT fields F70 (purpose) and F71 (charges) are null.  This constitutes a breach of the mandatory data capture requirement.

2. **HKMA-R-009** – A transaction of this size from a high‑risk jurisdiction (Iran) requires CDD before processing.  The transaction is marked as having no EDD required, yet the originator’s country is a high‑risk jurisdiction, so CDD should have been performed.  The mismatch between the flag and the actual requirement indicates non‑compliance.

3. **HKMA-R-010** – EDD is mandatory for customers from high‑risk jurisdictions.  The transaction is flagged as having performed EDD, but the system indicates that EDD was not required.  This contradiction suggests that the EDD performed may not have met the required depth, or that the system incorrectly marked the requirement.

4. **AML-SUS-04** – The transaction is unusually large, involves a high‑risk jurisdiction, and shows no evidence of a clear economic purpose.  The rule requires the transaction to be flagged, investigated, and an STR filed.  No STR has been filed (str_filed_datetime is null), and no suspicion has been determined, violating the investigation and reporting obligations.

5. **Sanctions Screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", indicating that the originator or beneficiary may be on a sanctions list.  Under the HKMA/SFC regime, any potential sanctions exposure must be reported and investigated.  The absence of an STR or any remedial action is a clear breach.

6. **Inconsistent Risk Assessment** – The customer is listed as a low‑risk individual but the client risk profile is marked high, and the system indicates that EDD was performed even though the flag says it was not required.  This inconsistency points to inadequate risk management processes.

Given the multiple rule breaches—especially the failure to capture required data, the omission of mandatory EDD for a high‑risk jurisdiction, and the lack of an STR for a potentially sanctioned transaction—the overall risk score is 88, placing the transaction in the ""Very High Risk"" category.

2. **HKMA‑R‑009** – Any occasional transaction of HK$120,000 or more (or any wire transfer of HK$8,000+) requires CDD. The transaction amount is GBP 412,043.37 (~HK$3.5 M), well above the threshold. The overdue KYC and lack of updated source‑of‑funds documentation violate this rule.

3. **MAS‑WIRE‑01** – For wire transfers of HK$8,000+ the originator’s address, identification number or date of birth, and the beneficiary’s address must be recorded. The transaction record lacks both addresses and the required identification details, violating the mandatory data capture requirement.

4. **MAS‑WIRE‑03** – When a beneficiary or intermediary receives a transfer missing required information, the institution must obtain the missing data within three business days or take mitigation measures. No such action is documented, creating a regulatory gap.

5. **AML‑SUS‑04** – The transaction is high‑value and involves cross‑border movement (AU → SG). Although not a high‑risk jurisdiction, the size and rapid movement of funds raise a suspicion flag that should trigger an internal review.

These multiple rule violations (overdue KYC, missing mandatory data, failure to obtain missing data, and a high‑value cross‑border transfer) place the transaction in the **High‑Risk** category, corresponding to a score of 80 on the 0‑100 scale.

The risk analysis must flag these categories and trigger EDD, which has been performed. 

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – The KYC due date (12/12/2021) has passed, indicating overdue customer data. The KRI for high‑risk clients would likely exceed tolerance thresholds for PEPs and high‑risk jurisdictions. EDD was performed, but the overdue KYC remains a compliance gap. 

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – No exception request is required because EDD was completed, but the absence of a documented SOW (sow_documented: false) is a missing control that could have justified an exception or additional monitoring. 

4. **FINMA‑RISK‑05** – The transaction is cross‑border (originator in VN, beneficiary in TH). While a consolidated risk analysis is required for international operations, the lack of evidence that this transaction was reviewed at the group level introduces a potential oversight. 

5. **Red flags** – PEP status, high‑risk jurisdictions, overdue KYC, missing SOW, and the fact that the transaction is a cash deposit (which can be used for layering) combine to push the risk close to the 85–95% threshold. 

Given these factors, the transaction is classified as **High Risk (score 78)**, indicating that it is near the upper end of the risk spectrum but still within the bounds of regulatory compliance due to the performed EDD.

2. **Inconsistent EDD status** – The transaction record shows ""edd_required"": false but ""edd_performed"": true. According to FINMA‑RISK‑02, EDD must be triggered only when a KRI indicates exposure above tolerance. Performing EDD when it is not required suggests a procedural lapse.
3. **Suspicious SWIFT F70 purpose** – The purpose field contains the phrase ""Including involve financial billion."" which is vague and potentially indicative of a suspicious transfer. While the product is low risk, the presence of a suspicious purpose increases the likelihood of money‑laundering activity (FINMA‑RISK‑01).
4. **Cross‑border channel (FPS HK)** – The transaction uses a Hong Kong FPS channel, which is not a high‑risk jurisdiction but adds complexity to the transaction flow and may trigger additional scrutiny under the consolidated risk analysis (FINMA‑RISK‑05) for international branches.

These factors collectively place the transaction in the **Medium‑Risk** band (46‑65).

1. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 5 Apr 2024 and was due on 5 Apr 2025, yet the transaction occurs on 30 Aug 2025. This violates the requirement in FINMA‑RISK‑01 that risk analysis documents must be updated with current data, and it triggers a potential breach of the risk tolerance set in FINMA‑RISK‑02.
2. **Sanctions screening flagged as ""potential""** – The system identified a potential sanctions match, but no suspicion was determined or a STR filed. Under FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑04, any potential sanctions match should be escalated and investigated, which is not reflected here.
3. **No EDD triggered** – Although EDD is not required per the customer risk rating, the overdue KYC and potential sanctions match would normally trigger EDD under FINMA‑RISK‑02 and FINMA‑RISK‑03. The fact that EDD was performed but not required indicates a procedural gap.
4. **Missing exception documentation** – If the bank had decided to allow the transaction despite the overdue KYC, an exception request with mitigation measures would be required per FINMA‑RISK‑03. No such documentation is present.

2. **Beneficial owner information** – For a legal person, MAS‑CDD‑02 mandates identification of beneficial owners unless exempt. No beneficial owner details are provided, creating a documentation gap.

These gaps do not trigger an immediate STR (MAS‑STR‑01) because the transaction is not suspicious in nature, but they do elevate the risk from very low to low.

2. **HKMA-R-009** – Although the transaction is a cheque, its value (≈HK$26,400) exceeds the HK$8,000 threshold for wire transfers and is close to the HK$120,000 threshold for large occasional transactions. The institution must still perform CDD on the originator and beneficiary, and the overdue KYC undermines this requirement.
3. **HKMA-R-010** – The originator is a domiciliary company from Indonesia (a country not listed as high‑risk) and the beneficiary is from Singapore. Neither party is a PEP or known suspect, but the large value and overdue KYC elevate the risk profile.
4. **AML-REC-02** – While not a stored‑value facility, the transaction involves a large cash‑equivalent instrument (cheque) that could be used for structuring or rapid movement of funds. The institution should monitor for structuring patterns.
5. **AML-REG-01 / AML-REG-02 / AML-REG-03** – The transaction is a securities trade; the institution must ensure that all regulatory notifications (e.g., changes in directors, address, or cessation of service) are up‑to‑date. The overdue KYC suggests potential lapses in ongoing monitoring.

Given the overdue KYC, the large transaction value, and the need for ongoing monitoring, the risk is elevated but not yet at the level of a clear violation. The score of 70 places the transaction in the ""High Risk"" band (85–95% threshold) but not in the ""Very High Risk"" band, reflecting the presence of significant compliance gaps without an outright rule breach.

1. **KYC Overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 27/12/2020 and was due on 27/12/2022, making it overdue by two years. Under FINMA‑RISK‑02, a KYC that is not up‑to‑date should trigger a KRI and, if the risk tolerance is exceeded, an EDD requirement. Although EDD was performed, the overdue KYC remains a compliance gap.

2. **PEP Status** – The customer is flagged as a PEP. FINMA‑RISK‑02 requires that any PEP exposure that exceeds the defined tolerance triggers EDD. The transaction is already marked as EDD‑required and performed, but the presence of a PEP adds to the risk profile.

3. **Sanctions Screening – Potential** – The sanctions screening result is “potential”, indicating that the customer or transaction may match a sanctions list. FINMA‑RISK‑02 and FINMA‑RISK‑05 require that any potential sanctions match be investigated and, if confirmed, trigger EDD. The fact that the screening is only “potential” is a red flag.

4. **Cash Deposit Channel & Amount** – A cash deposit of CHF 20,000 is a high‑risk channel. The customer’s daily cash total before the transaction was CHF 17,680.21; after the transaction it would exceed CHF 37,680.21. If the bank’s daily cash threshold is around CHF 20,000 (a common threshold), this transaction would breach the KRI set in FINMA‑RISK‑02.

5. **Missing Documentation** – The transaction lacks a documented Statement of Work (SOW) and the customer’s KYC is overdue. Under FINMA‑RISK‑01, the risk analysis must record all risk categories and controls; the absence of updated KYC and SOW indicates incomplete documentation.

6. **Exception Process** – Because the transaction potentially breaches the daily cash threshold and involves a PEP with overdue KYC, an exception request would normally be required under FINMA‑RISK‑03. No evidence of an exception request or board approval is provided.

Given these multiple gaps and the proximity to breaching key KRIs, the transaction falls into the ""High Risk"" category (66‑85).

1. **HKMA-R-009 (Large‑value CDD)** – The transfer exceeds HK$120,000, so CDD must be performed. The customer’s KYC was last completed on 6/12/2022 and was due on 4/6/2023, meaning the KYC is now over a year overdue. This constitutes a clear violation of the CDD obligation.

2. **AML-CDD-01 (Basic CDD)** – The institution must collect and verify the customer’s identity, source of funds and transaction purpose. While the transaction includes a purpose code (INV) and a narrative, there is no documented source‑of‑funds evidence, and the originator/beneficiary address and identification details are missing. This is a gap in the required CDD documentation.

3. **HKMA-R-008 (Beneficial ownership)** – The customer is a corporate entity, yet no beneficial ownership information is provided. The regulation requires that the institution knows who ultimately owns or controls more than 25% of the entity. The absence of this information is a compliance shortfall.

4. **MAS-WIRE-01 (Wire‑transfer record‑keeping)** – For transfers above HK$8,000 the institution must record the originator’s account number, address, identification number or DOB, and the beneficiary’s name and account number. The transaction record lacks the originator’s address and identification details, and the beneficiary’s address is also missing. This incomplete data set violates the record‑keeping requirement.

5. **MAS-WIRE-03 (Missing data handling)** – Because the beneficiary’s address is missing, the beneficiary institution would be required to obtain the missing information within three business days. Failure to do so could lead to restriction or termination of the relationship.

6. **AML-SUS-04 (Suspicious activity flagging)** – The transaction is large, cross‑border, and involves a corporate customer with overdue KYC. These factors would likely trigger a suspicious‑activity flag under this rule, requiring further investigation.

Although the customer is not a PEP, the sanctions screening result is “potential”, indicating a possible match on a sanctions list; this triggers the need for further investigation under AML‑SUS‑04 and the EDD requirement in HKMA‑R‑010 if a high‑risk jurisdiction or suspect is identified.

4. **Overdue KYC** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 13/6/2022 and was due 13/6/2023. An overdue KYC violates AML‑CDD‑01 and undermines the integrity of the CDD/EDD process.

No exception request form, board approval, or mitigation plan is documented for this transaction, violating the exception‑process requirement.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The risk analysis must flag all categories that require EDD. The transaction’s EDD flag is incorrectly set to false, meaning the risk analysis failed to identify the high‑risk jurisdiction exposure.

4. **KYC compliance** – The customer’s KYC due date (2 May 2025) has passed by 15 days at the time of booking (17 May 2025). While the system performed EDD, the overdue KYC status is a compliance gap that could elevate risk.

1. **MAS‑CDD‑01** – The amount (HKD 1,620,851.19) far exceeds the S20,000 threshold for non‑account transactions, requiring full CDD.  The customer is a corporate PEP with a high risk rating, so EDD is mandatory.  While EDD is marked as performed, the record does not confirm that all required documents (ID, proof of address, beneficial owner details, source of wealth/funds, senior‑management approval) were supplied, creating a compliance gap.

2. **MAS‑CDD‑02** – The corporate customer’s beneficial owners are not documented in the transaction record.  This omission violates the obligation to identify and verify beneficial owners for legal persons.

3. **MAS‑CDD‑03** – The customer is a PEP; EDD must include senior‑management approval, source‑of‑wealth documentation, and an enhanced monitoring plan.  The absence of evidence for these controls raises a red flag.

4. **MAS‑WIRE‑01 / MAS‑WIRE‑02** – The payment is a cross‑border FAST transfer.  Originator and beneficiary details are present, satisfying the basic requirement, but the transaction is large and involves a PEP, which may trigger EDD under MAS‑WIRE‑01.  MAS‑WIRE‑02 would require investigation if any information were missing, which is not the case here.

5. **MAS‑MON‑01** – Ongoing monitoring is required for large, complex transactions.  The record shows no evidence of an ongoing monitoring plan or escalation procedures for this high‑risk customer.

6. **MAS‑STR‑01** – The sanctions screening result is ""potential"", indicating a possible sanctions hit.  Under MAS, any potential sanctions or suspicious activity should prompt an STR.  No STR has been filed yet.

7. **Additional red flags** – The KYC was last completed on 31/03/2020 and was due on 27/09/2020, meaning the KYC is overdue.

Although EDD has been performed and a Statement of Work (SOW) is documented, the customer’s KYC was last completed in May 2019 and was due in May 2020, indicating overdue compliance documentation.

2. **MAS‑CDD‑02** – The customer is a domiciliary company.  The regulatory framework requires identification of beneficial owners for legal persons.  No beneficial‑owner details are present in the transaction record, constituting a missing key document.

3. **MAS‑CDD‑05** – The customer is rated ""High"" risk and is not a PEP or from a high‑risk jurisdiction, so simplified CDD is not applicable.  The presence of a high‑risk rating combined with a large cash transaction heightens scrutiny.

4. **MAS‑STR‑01** – No Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) has been filed.  The combination of a large cash outflow, overdue KYC, and missing beneficial‑owner information would normally trigger an STR under MAS rules.

5. **Other red flags** – The transaction is a cash withdrawal (a high‑risk channel for money‑laundering), the originator country (Thailand) is not a high‑risk jurisdiction but the beneficiary is in France, and the narrative field contains nonsensical text, suggesting potential data quality issues.

2. **High‑risk jurisdictions** – Beneficiary country RU and originator country AE are considered high‑risk jurisdictions.  This activates the travel‑rule and the requirement for full originator/beneficiary details (MAS‑WIRE‑01, AML‑SUS‑04).
3. **PEP status** – The customer is flagged as a PEP, mandating EDD (HKMA‑R‑010, MAS‑EDD‑01).  EDD has been performed, but the presence of a PEP still elevates the risk profile.
4. **Potential sanctions exposure** – The sanctions screening result is ""potential"", indicating that the customer or counterparties may appear on a sanctions list.  This is a critical red flag under the AML/CFT regime.
5. **Timing of KYC** – The KYC completion date (18/09/2024) is after the transaction date (26/01/2024), suggesting that the KYC records may not have been in place at the time of the transaction, which is a compliance gap.

The product is a cash deposit via cheque, a low‑complexity product but still high risk when combined with cross‑border activity. The booking jurisdiction is CH, but the transaction involves foreign accounts, creating a cross‑border exposure that must be captured in the risk analysis.

2. **Risk tolerance & KRIs (FINMA‑RISK‑02)** – The transaction exceeds the typical tolerance limits for high‑risk client segments and jurisdictions. The KRI dashboard is not referenced in the data, and there is no evidence that the transaction was flagged against a quantitative limit. The lack of a real‑time KRI status indicates a gap in monitoring.

3. **Exception process (FINMA‑RISK‑03)** – No exception request form or board approval is documented. The transaction should have triggered an exception request because it falls outside the defined tolerance for high‑risk jurisdictions.

4. **Review & update (FINMA‑RISK‑04)** – The risk analysis appears not to have been updated to reflect the new high‑risk exposure (originator/beneficiary countries). The transaction is not covered by an updated risk analysis that would have identified the need for EDD.

5. **Consolidated analysis (FINMA‑RISK‑05)** – The bank has international branches (GB accounts). The transaction is cross‑border and would need to be reflected in a consolidated risk analysis. No consolidated KRI dashboard or board approval is shown.

6. **EDD mismatch** – The data indicates ""edd_required"": false but ""edd_performed"": true. This inconsistency suggests that the EDD trigger logic was not correctly applied. Moreover, sanctions screening is marked ""none"" despite the high‑risk jurisdictions involved, which is a regulatory red flag.

The rule mandates that if a KRI indicates exposure above tolerance, EDD must be triggered. Failure to perform EDD constitutes a direct violation, contributing heavily to the risk score.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The transaction involves a high‑risk jurisdiction (originator country RU) and a PEP customer. The risk analysis must record and monitor such categories. The lack of documented EDD and the presence of a potential sanctions screening issue suggest that the institution’s risk analysis is incomplete or not fully applied to this transaction.

3. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", indicating a possible match with sanctions lists. Under FINMA guidance, any potential sanctions match requires immediate action and documentation, which is missing here.

4. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 5/8/2021 and was due on 5/8/2022, yet the transaction occurs in 2024. This overdue status violates the requirement for up‑to‑date KYC data before processing transactions.

5. **High‑risk client profile** – The customer is a PEP with a medium risk rating, yet the transaction is a fund subscription involving a cheque, a medium‑risk product. The combination of PEP status, high‑risk jurisdiction, and lack of EDD elevates the risk.

Given these multiple violations and gaps, the transaction falls into the ""High Risk"" category (66‑85) with a score of 80, reflecting significant non‑compliance and potential regulatory breach.

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The transaction involves a beneficiary in Russia (high‑risk jurisdiction) and a cash channel, both high‑risk categories that must be recorded in the bank’s risk analysis. The bank’s internal risk analysis must flag this exposure.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – The KRI for high‑risk jurisdictions is likely set at a threshold (e.g., CHF 10,000 per day). The amount of CHF 10,518.67 exceeds this threshold, and the daily cash total for the customer is CHF 21,163.06, indicating a potential breach of the tolerance limit. The KRI would therefore trigger an alert.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – Because the transaction breaches the tolerance for a high‑risk jurisdiction, an exception process should be invoked. The exception request must include an EDD plan, board approval, and ongoing monitoring. Although EDD was performed, the bank did not document an exception request or board approval, which is a compliance gap.

4. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 28/12/2022 and was due on 28/12/2023, meaning the KYC is now 11 months overdue. This is a significant risk factor that should have triggered EDD or an exception.

5. **Missing documentation** – While the transaction includes SWIFT F50/F59 and the travel rule is complete, there is no evidence of a sanctions screening for the beneficiary country (Russia). The sanctions screening field shows ""none"", which may indicate that no screening was performed or that the beneficiary was not flagged. This is a potential gap.

1. **High‑risk jurisdiction exposure** – The beneficiary is in Indonesia (ID), a high‑risk jurisdiction per FINMA guidelines. The amount (£206,984) far exceeds typical high‑risk thresholds (often >£100k). FINMA‑RISK‑02 requires that such exposure be monitored via KRIs and trigger EDD if limits are breached. The record shows ""edd_required"": false while ""edd_performed"": true, indicating a mismatch and a violation of FINMA‑RISK‑02.

2. **Overdue KYC** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 29/09/2022 and was due on 28/03/2023, making it more than two years overdue. FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑04 mandate up‑to‑date KYC data and periodic reviews. This overdue KYC is a compliance gap.

3. **Potential sanctions match** – Sanctions screening returned ""potential"". FINMA requires that any potential sanctions match trigger EDD. The transaction has EDD performed but the system indicates it was not required, again violating FINMA‑RISK‑02.

4. **Product complexity** – The transaction is a fund subscription marked as ""product_complex"": true. FINMA‑RISK‑01 states that complex products increase inherent risk and require enhanced controls. No evidence of enhanced due diligence for this product is documented.

5. **Cross‑border channel** – The payment is routed via FPS (HK) to a foreign beneficiary. FINMA‑RISK‑05 requires a consolidated risk analysis for international branches that captures cross‑border activity. The transaction is not reflected in the group‑level risk analysis, indicating a gap.

6. **Missing exception approval** – According to FINMA‑RISK‑03, any high‑risk transaction that would breach tolerance must be approved by the executive board with an EDD plan. No exception request or board approval is documented.

7. **Missing KRI dashboard and board logs** – FINMA‑RISK‑02 requires a real‑time KRI dashboard and board approval logs. These are absent.

8. **Incomplete documentation** – BIC codes for ordering and beneficiary institutions are missing, and the swift MT is null. The narrative is vague, and the purpose code ""SVC"" is not fully explained, raising suspicion.

9. **No STR filed** – Despite a potential sanctions match, no Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) has been filed, violating FINMA‑RISK‑01.

Given the combination of high‑risk jurisdiction exposure, overdue KYC, potential sanctions match, product complexity, cross‑border nature, lack of board approval, missing documentation, and failure to file an STR, the transaction is in clear violation of multiple FINMA rules. This warrants the maximum risk score of 100, indicating a very high risk and a need for immediate remedial action.

1. **AML‑CDD‑01 & HKMA‑R‑007** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 26/08/2022 and the due date was 22/02/2023, i.e. the KYC is overdue by two years.  The regulator requires that identity, source of funds and purpose be verified before providing a service; an overdue KYC is a clear compliance breach.

2. **HKMA‑R‑009** – The transfer (≈HK$480,000) exceeds the HK$8,000 threshold for wire transfers, so full CDD is mandatory.  While the required originator/beneficiary details are present, the overdue KYC undermines the integrity of the CDD.

3. **HKMA‑R‑010** – The client is flagged as a high‑risk profile but the risk rating is listed as Low and the customer is not a PEP.  This mismatch indicates a potential gap in the risk assessment process.

4. **AML‑SUS‑04** – The transaction was flagged as suspicious (suspicion_determined_datetime) and an STR was filed the following day.  The narrative is vague and the purpose code ‘MED’ does not clearly explain the large amount, raising concerns about possible structuring or lack of economic rationale.

5. **MAS‑WIRE‑01** – The transaction meets the threshold and all required fields (originator/beneficiary details, swift f50/f59, travel rule) are present, so no violation here.  However, the fact that EDD was performed (edd_performed = true) when the rule states it is not required (edd_required = false) suggests an over‑application of controls rather than a deficiency.

6. **HKMA‑R‑011** – Continuous monitoring is required for high‑risk customers.  The system recorded a high risk profile but the suitability assessment was marked as ‘match’ with no evidence of ongoing review, indicating a potential lapse in monitoring.

Overall, the transaction is compliant with the technical record‑keeping and data‑capture requirements but suffers from significant procedural gaps: overdue KYC, inconsistent risk classification, and a suspicious transaction that was flagged and reported.  These issues place the transaction in the **High‑Risk** band (66‑85).  A score of 75 reflects the presence of multiple red‑flags without outright rule violations that would push it into the Very‑High range.

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The risk analysis must cover client domicile, geography, and product. This transaction involves a cash withdrawal (high‑risk product) for a corporate client whose originator country is Australia and beneficiary country is Indonesia – a jurisdiction that is typically classified as high risk for money laundering. The high‑risk geography and product categories are likely to exceed the bank’s predefined tolerance limits.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – Key risk indicators (KRIs) for cash withdrawals above a certain threshold (often around CHF 10,000–CHF 20,000) would be triggered by an 87,619.35 GBP withdrawal. The KRI for high‑risk jurisdictions would also be breached because the beneficiary country is Indonesia. Since the KRI threshold is likely exceeded, EDD should have been triggered, but the system indicates that EDD was not required.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – Because the transaction falls outside the normal risk tolerance (high cash amount, high‑risk jurisdiction, cash channel), an exception request would normally be required. The absence of an exception request or documented mitigation plan is a gap.

4. **KYC compliance** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 28/07/2022 and was due on 24/01/2023, meaning the KYC is overdue by more than a year. This is a significant compliance gap that increases the risk profile.

5. **Suspicion flag** – The transaction was flagged as suspicious on the same day it was booked, indicating that internal monitoring systems detected a potential issue.

6. **Mitigating factors** – EDD was performed (despite not being required), a statement of work was documented, travel rule compliance is complete, and no sanctions screening issues were found. These factors mitigate the risk somewhat but do not eliminate the red‑flags.

Overall, the transaction sits in the ""High Risk"" band (66‑85) because it triggers multiple risk categories, exceeds likely KRI thresholds, and has compliance gaps (overdue KYC, lack of exception process).

This exceeds typical tolerance thresholds for KYC validity and would normally trigger an EDD. The transaction also involves high‑risk jurisdictions (UAE and China), which are monitored by KRIs for cross‑border exposure. The fact that the KRI for high‑risk jurisdiction exposure is likely breached (no evidence of a KRI dashboard or tolerance limit being met) indicates a violation.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑01 (Risk analysis & EDD flagging)** – The transaction involves high‑risk jurisdictions and a high‑risk client profile, which should have been flagged for EDD. Although EDD was performed, the analysis does not show that the transaction was flagged as exceeding tolerance or that the EDD was triggered by a KRI. This suggests a gap in the risk analysis process.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03 (Exception process)** – The transaction falls outside the defined risk tolerance (high‑risk client, high‑risk jurisdictions, overdue KYC). The documentation does not include an exception request form, board approval minutes, or an ongoing monitoring plan. This omission violates the requirement for an exception process when a transaction breaches tolerance.

4. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", indicating a possible match with sanctions lists. This is a significant red flag that should have triggered additional scrutiny or a halt to the transaction.

5. **Contradictory risk rating** – The customer risk rating is listed as ""Low"" while the client risk profile is ""High"". This inconsistency points to a breakdown in the risk assessment process.

1. **High‑risk jurisdiction exposure (FINMA‑RISK‑01)** – The originator is from Iran, a high‑risk jurisdiction. The risk analysis must flag such categories and trigger enhanced due diligence (EDD). Although EDD was performed, the system records that EDD was not required, indicating a mismatch and a potential oversight in the risk analysis.

2. **Missing key risk indicators and tolerance limits (FINMA‑RISK‑02)** – There is no evidence of a defined risk tolerance statement, KRI dashboard, or board approval log for this transaction. The lack of these controls means the bank cannot monitor whether exposure to high‑risk clients or jurisdictions remains within acceptable limits.

3. **Exception process not documented (FINMA‑RISK‑03)** – The transaction involves a high‑risk client segment (originator from Iran) but there is no exception request form, board minutes, or ongoing monitoring plan. The absence of an approved exception process violates the requirement to allow the executive board to approve out‑of‑tolerance cases.

4. **Periodic review and update missing (FINMA‑RISK‑04)** – The KYC for the customer is overdue (last completed 21/7/2022, due 21/7/2023). The risk analysis has not been updated to reflect this change, and there is no board approval documentation for a review that would capture the new high‑risk exposure.

5. **Consolidated risk analysis not performed (FINMA‑RISK‑05)** – As a Swiss‑based bank with international operations, a consolidated risk analysis covering all branches and group entities is required. The transaction involves cross‑border activity (originator in GB, beneficiary in GB, but originating from Iran), yet there is no consolidated KRI dashboard or board approval for group‑level risk assessment.

6. **Suspicion and STR filing** – The system flagged the transaction as suspicious (suspicion_determined_datetime) and filed a STR (str_filed_datetime). This indicates that the transaction was deemed potentially illicit, reinforcing the high‑risk assessment.

Given the combination of high‑risk jurisdiction exposure, missing documentation, lack of risk tolerance/KRI controls, and the fact that the transaction was flagged as suspicious, the risk score is placed in the Very High Risk band (86‑100).

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The risk analysis must flag any category that requires EDD. The system indicates EDD performed but not required, suggesting the risk analysis did not correctly flag this transaction.

4. **Cash ID Verification** – The field ""cash_id_verified"" is false. Cash deposits are a known high‑risk channel; lack of ID verification is a red flag and violates internal AML controls.

5. **Missing BICs** – Ordering and beneficiary institution BICs are null, which is inconsistent with the presence of swift_f50 and swift_f59. This indicates incomplete transaction data.

2. **HKMA‑R‑009** – The transfer amount (SGD 1,212,248.41) far exceeds the 120,000‑threshold for wire transfers, so CDD is mandatory. Although EDD was performed, the overdue KYC undermines the adequacy of the due‑diligence process. 
3. **AML‑SUS‑04** – The transaction is unusually large and involves a cross‑border transfer (JP → DE). While neither jurisdiction is high‑risk, the sheer size and rapid movement of funds raise a suspicion flag. 
4. **MAS‑WIRE‑01** – The required originator and beneficiary details are present, satisfying the record‑keeping requirement.

The KRI for high‑risk client exposure would likely be breached, but EDD was triggered and performed. However, the large amount combined with the PEP status and cross‑border nature raises the KRI score close to the tolerance limit.

• **FINMA‑RISK‑03**: No exception request was needed because EDD was performed, but the presence of a potential sanctions flag means the exception process would have required an EDD plan if an exception had been sought.

• **FINMA‑RISK‑04**: The transaction was booked after the KYC due date, suggesting the risk analysis may not have been updated to reflect the current risk profile. This is a minor gap but still a red flag.

• **FINMA‑RISK‑05**: The cross‑border nature (originator TH, beneficiary SG) triggers the consolidated risk analysis requirement. The transaction is flagged for EDD, satisfying the requirement, but the potential sanctions screening indicates a high‑risk cross‑border activity.

1. **High‑risk jurisdictions** – The originator is from Vietnam and the beneficiary from China, both considered high‑risk jurisdictions under FINMA risk categories. This violates the risk tolerance thresholds for high‑risk client segments (FINMA‑RISK‑02) and requires Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). The transaction is flagged as a cash withdrawal, a high‑risk product, and the amount (USD 9,103) is close to typical cash‑withdrawal thresholds that banks set for high‑risk clients.

2. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", indicating a possible sanctions match. Under FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑02, any potential sanctions match must be escalated and EDD performed. The presence of a potential sanctions match alone elevates the risk to the high‑risk band.

3. **EDD mismatch** – The transaction record shows ""edd_required"": false but ""edd_performed"": true. This inconsistency suggests a compliance gap: EDD was performed when it was not required, or the system incorrectly flagged the transaction as low risk. FINMA‑RISK‑02 requires that if a KRI indicates exposure above tolerance, EDD must be triggered; the mismatch indicates a failure to follow the prescribed process.

4. **Missing exception approval** – The transaction is a cash withdrawal from a corporate account involving high‑risk jurisdictions. According to FINMA‑RISK‑03, any transaction that would otherwise breach the risk tolerance must be approved by the executive board with an EDD plan. No exception request or board approval is documented.

5. **Incomplete documentation** – While the transaction has a documented statement of work (sow_documented: true) and suitability assessment, the sanctions screening result is only ""potential"" and no suspicious transaction report (STR) has been filed. The absence of an STR despite a potential sanctions match is a compliance shortfall.

Given these multiple red flags—high‑risk jurisdictions, potential sanctions, EDD mismatch, lack of exception approval, and incomplete documentation—the transaction falls into the ""High Risk"" category (66‑85) but is close to the very high risk threshold due to the sanctions issue and procedural gaps. Therefore a risk score of 88 is assigned.

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The risk analysis must record all risk categories. While the bank has performed EDD, the transaction involves a high‑risk client profile and a complex securities trade, which should have been flagged in the risk analysis. The presence of a ""potential"" sanctions match (sanctions_screening: ""potential"") is a clear risk signal that the transaction should have been highlighted in the risk analysis.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – Key risk indicators (KRIs) for high‑risk client segments and jurisdictions are required. The client is a domiciliary company with a high risk profile, and the transaction is cross‑border (SG → JP). The amount (120,651 JPY ≈ 900 CHF) is modest, but the product complexity and sanctions potential raise the KRI score. The fact that EDD was performed but not formally required indicates a potential lapse in the KRI monitoring process.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – An exception process is needed for high‑risk client relationships that would otherwise breach tolerance. The transaction falls into the high‑risk category, yet the exception request form and board approval documentation are not shown. The EDD performed may cover the mitigation plan, but the absence of documented exception approval is a compliance gap.

4. **FINMA‑RISK‑05** – As an international transaction, a consolidated risk analysis should capture cross‑border activity. The transaction involves a foreign originator (SG) and beneficiary (JP). The lack of a consolidated KRI dashboard entry for this transaction suggests a missing oversight layer.

5. **Missing documentation** – Key SWIFT fields are null (swift_f70_purpose, swift_f71_charges), which are required for a complete transaction record. This omission further elevates the risk.

Given these factors—potential sanctions exposure, high client risk profile, product complexity, missing key documentation, and incomplete exception/approval records—the transaction sits in the **High Risk** band (66‑85). Therefore, a risk score of 75 is assigned.",0.018148875,0,

4. **Incomplete source‑of‑funds information** – The transaction record lacks explicit source‑of‑funds documentation, a key component of EDD for PEPs (rule HKMA‑R‑010) and continuous monitoring (rule HKMA‑R‑011).

1. **High‑risk jurisdiction (HK)** – Under FINMA, Hong Kong is typically classified as a high‑risk jurisdiction. The transaction originates and terminates in HK, which triggers the risk signals in FINMA‑RISK‑01 (new or increased exposure to high‑risk jurisdictions) and FINMA‑RISK‑02 (monitoring of high‑risk client segments and jurisdictions). The amount (€152,472) likely exceeds the typical tolerance threshold for a single high‑risk transaction, pushing the KRI above the 85–95% threshold and moving the score into the High‑Risk band.

2. **Potential sanctions screening** – The sanctions screening result is marked as ""potential"", a clear red flag that requires Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). Although EDD was performed, the fact that the screening flagged a potential sanction raises concern and indicates that the transaction may not fully comply with FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑02.

3. **Overdue KYC** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 13/6/2020 and was due on 13/6/2021, meaning the KYC is now overdue. This violates the requirement in FINMA‑RISK‑01 to use up‑to‑date data sources for risk assessment and suggests a lapse in the bank’s ongoing monitoring processes.

4. **Missing or incomplete documentation** – While the transaction includes many required fields (SWIFT MT103, F50/F59, travel rule, etc.), the narrative and purpose code are vague, and the F70 purpose field contains nonsensical text. This lack of clear transaction purpose could be considered a documentation gap under FINMA‑RISK‑01.

5. **Exception process** – No exception request is recorded. If the transaction had exceeded the bank’s risk tolerance, an exception would need to be documented and approved per FINMA‑RISK‑03. The absence of such documentation suggests the bank may not have formally addressed the risk.

6. **Periodic review** – The transaction was booked on 4/4/2024. If the bank’s last risk‑analysis review was more than a year ago, the transaction would fall under the review cycle requirement of FINMA‑RISK‑04, potentially missing a recent update to risk tolerance limits.

Given these factors, the transaction sits in the ""High Risk"" band (66‑85) but is close to the ""Very High Risk"" threshold due to the sanctions flag and overdue KYC. A score of 75 reflects a moderate‑to‑high risk that requires close monitoring and potential escalation to senior management for review.

1. **Out‑of‑date KYC** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 24/12/2020 and was due on 24/12/2021, making it overdue by five months. HKMA‑R‑009 requires CDD for any transaction ≥HK$120,000 (or equivalent) unless the customer is a pre‑existing customer with current CDD. The overdue KYC constitutes a direct violation of HKMA‑R‑009 and HKMA‑R‑007.

2. **Missing mandatory wire‑transfer data** – MAS‑WIRE‑01 mandates that for every wire transfer ≥HK$8,000 the originator’s account number, address, identification number (or DOB), and the beneficiary’s name and account number must be recorded. The transaction lacks originator and beneficiary addresses and identification numbers, and MAS‑WIRE‑03 requires the institution to obtain the missing data within three business days or take remedial action. Failure to do so is a regulatory breach.

3. **Suitability assessment not performed** – The product is classified as complex and is a securities trade. Internal and regulatory guidance (AML‑GUIDE‑05, HKMA‑R‑011) requires a suitability assessment for such products. The record shows ""suitability_assessed"": false with a mismatch result, indicating that the product may not be appropriate for the client. This is a compliance failure.

4. **EDD not performed for a high‑risk transaction** – The transaction amount (≈HK$3.3 million) far exceeds the HK$120,000 threshold, and the beneficiary is located in the UAE, a high‑risk jurisdiction. HKMA‑R‑010 mandates EDD for customers from high‑risk jurisdictions or with high‑risk source of wealth. Although the customer is not a PEP, the cross‑border nature and large value trigger EDD, which was not performed (edd_required: false, edd_performed: true). This is a regulatory violation.

5. **Cross‑border to a high‑risk jurisdiction** – The beneficiary country (AE) is considered high risk under HKMA guidelines. Combined with the large value, this elevates the transaction’s risk profile.

6. **No STR filed despite red flags** – The transaction has no suspicious transaction report (str_filed_datetime: null) despite multiple red flags, indicating a failure to comply with AML‑SUS‑04.

The transaction is a cash withdrawal, which is a low‑inherent‑risk product, but the combination of a high‑risk client and a high‑risk jurisdiction elevates the overall risk. 

Key red flags:
- **Sanctions screening** returned ""potential"", indicating a possible match with a sanctions list. This is a significant red flag that could trigger EDD under FINMA‑RISK‑02 and FINMA‑RISK‑05 if the bank operates internationally.
- **High‑risk client**: The customer is already flagged as high risk, and the transaction is not covered by any specific exemption or exception process (FINMA‑RISK‑03). The EDD has been performed, but the presence of a sanctions potential match suggests that the risk tolerance may have been breached.
- **Documentation**: While EDD has been performed and the transaction is documented, the sanctions potential match is not fully resolved, and no additional mitigation measures are recorded. This gap aligns with the high‑risk category (66‑85) where key documents or mitigation plans may be missing.

The record shows only a generic ‘EDD performed’ flag but lacks evidence of a comprehensive risk assessment, identity verification, and beneficial‑owner identification for the corporate customer. This constitutes a breach of the rule.

2. **MAS-CDD-02** – The customer is a legal person (corporate) and the system does not contain any beneficial‑owner details. The rule mandates identification and verification of all beneficial owners unless exempted, which is not the case here. The absence of this information is a clear violation.

3. **MAS-CDD-05** – The customer is classified as low risk, but the sanctions screening result is “potential”, indicating a possible sanctions hit. Simplified CDD is only permissible for customers with no sanctions or adverse media hits. Therefore, simplified CDD is insufficient and the transaction should have undergone EDD.

4. **MAS-CDD-06** – Although the transaction is not a digital‑token transfer, the high value and cross‑border nature (originator FR, beneficiary ID) raise the risk profile. The product is marked as complex, further increasing scrutiny.

5. **MAS-STR-01** – The presence of a potential sanctions hit and the missing beneficial‑owner data should trigger an STR filing. The absence of an STR filing (str_filed_datetime is null) is a compliance gap.

1. **KYC overdue (MAS‑CDD‑01)** – The customer’s last KYC was completed on 26/12/2019 and the due date was 23/6/2020, well beyond the statutory renewal period. Conducting a cash withdrawal without a current CDD record contravenes the obligation to verify identity before any transaction, even if the amount is below the S20,000 threshold.

2. **Potential sanctions hit (MAS‑CDD‑05)** – The sanctions screening result is marked as ""potential"", indicating a possible match with a sanctioned entity or individual. MAS requires that any suspicion of sanctions or adverse media triggers enhanced due diligence; the use of simplified CDD for a customer with a potential sanctions hit is a regulatory breach.

3. **Suspicion flagged and STR filed (MAS‑STR‑01 & MAS‑MON‑01)** – The system flagged the transaction as suspicious and an STR was filed. While filing an STR is compliant, the fact that the transaction was deemed suspicious indicates that the bank’s monitoring system detected a high‑risk pattern, which is consistent with the requirement to perform EDD when suspicious activity is identified.

4. **Cash channel risk** – Cash withdrawals are inherently higher risk for money‑laundering than electronic transfers. The transaction is a cash withdrawal of €516.86, which, although below the S20,000 threshold, still falls under the higher scrutiny category for cash movements.

5. **Inconsistent EDD flag** – The transaction record shows ""edd_required"": false but ""edd_performed"": true. This inconsistency suggests a procedural lapse: EDD should have been required given the KYC expiry and potential sanctions hit.

Taken together, these factors place the transaction in the **High‑Risk** band (85‑95).

2. **MAS‑CDD‑02** – The customer is a domiciliary company; the system must identify and verify all beneficial owners. No beneficial‑owner details are provided, violating the requirement.

1. **Expired KYC** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 28/10/2019 and was due on 27/10/2020, meaning the institution is operating with outdated customer information.

2. **Potential Sanctions Screening** – The sanctions screening result is “potential”, indicating that the customer may be on or near a sanctions list.

3. **EDD Status** – The transaction record shows `edd_performed: true` but `edd_required: false`. Since the customer is not a PEP or high‑risk, the EDD performed appears discretionary; however, the potential sanctions flag suggests EDD should have been mandatory.

1. **AML‑CDD‑01** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 13/03/2022 and was due on 09/09/2022, i.e., the KYC is overdue by ~4 months. This is a clear compliance breach.
2. **MAS‑WIRE‑01** – The transfer amount (≈HK$110,000) exceeds the HK$8,000 wire‑transfer threshold, so EDD is mandatory. EDD was performed, but the sanctions screening result is ""potential"", indicating a possible sanctions match – a serious red‑flag that should trigger an STR.
3. **AML‑SUS‑04** – The transaction is cross‑border (originator TH, beneficiary US) and involves a large cash‑equivalent amount. No STR has been filed, despite the potential sanctions match and the high client risk profile.
4. **Inconsistent data** – The product type is ""cash_withdrawal"" while the channel is ""Cash"" yet the transaction is a UK‑UK wire transfer (originator and beneficiary accounts are UK). The originator country is listed as TH, which does not match the account country. Such inconsistencies raise concerns about data integrity and potential misreporting.
5. **High client risk profile** – The customer is flagged as ""High"" risk, yet the risk rating is ""Low"" and the customer is not a PEP. This mismatch suggests incomplete or inaccurate risk assessment.

Given the combination of overdue KYC, potential sanctions exposure, lack of an STR, and data inconsistencies, the transaction sits in the ""Very High Risk"" band (86‑100). A score of 90 reflects the severity of the violations and the likelihood of regulatory enforcement action.

Additionally, the customer is a domiciliary company (customer_type: domiciliary_company) and the regulatory framework (MAS‑CDD‑02) requires identification and verification of beneficial owners for all legal persons unless exempt. No beneficial‑owner information is provided in the transaction record, creating another compliance gap.

The KYC for the customer expired on 20/11/2022 (kyc_due_date) and has not been refreshed (kyc_last_completed: 20/11/2021). An overdue KYC for a high‑risk, PEP customer is a significant red flag and further pushes the risk into the high‑risk range.

1. **Product risk** – Cash withdrawals are inherently high‑risk (FINMA‑RISK‑01).  The amount of GBP 5,170.91 is moderate but still falls within the typical threshold for heightened scrutiny of cash‑based transactions.  
2. **KYC status** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 20/3/2022 and was due on 20/3/2023, making it overdue by 1½ years.  According to FINMA‑RISK‑02, any KYC lapse that exceeds the tolerance period should trigger EDD.  Although EDD was performed, the overdue status itself is a risk signal.  
3. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is “potential”, indicating a possible match with a sanctions list.  This is a key risk indicator that requires EDD (FINMA‑RISK‑02) and may necessitate an exception process (FINMA‑RISK‑03).  
4. **Geography & client domicile** – The originator is from Japan (JP).  While JP is not a high‑risk jurisdiction, the cross‑border nature of the transaction (originator JP → beneficiary CH) adds complexity and is monitored under FINMA‑RISK‑05 for consolidated risk.  
5. **Documentation gaps** – The transaction lacks a clear purpose code (swift_f70_purpose is null) and the swift_f71_charges field is missing, which are required for full compliance under FINMA‑RISK‑01.

1. **High‑risk jurisdiction exposure (FINMA‑RISK‑01)** – The originator is a Russian national (RU), a high‑risk jurisdiction for money‑laundering. The risk analysis must flag such exposure and trigger Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). The transaction record shows `edd_required: false` while EDD was performed, indicating a mismatch and a failure to trigger the required EDD process.

2. **KYC overdue (FINMA‑RISK‑01 & 02)** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 17/12/2021 and was due on 17/12/2023, meaning the KYC is now two years overdue. This violates the requirement to keep KYC data current and increases the likelihood that the customer’s risk profile has changed.

3. **Sanctions screening flagged as ""potential"" (FINMA‑RISK‑01)** – A potential sanctions match is a serious red‑flag. The transaction should have triggered additional scrutiny and possibly a sanctions‑specific EDD, which is not documented.

4. **Cash deposit from a high‑risk client (FINMA‑RISK‑02)** – Cash deposits are inherently higher risk, especially when originating from a high‑risk jurisdiction. The KRI for high‑risk client exposure would likely be breached, requiring an exception approval (FINMA‑RISK‑03). No exception request or board approval is recorded.

5. **Missing exception process documentation (FINMA‑RISK‑03)** – The transaction falls outside the defined risk tolerance for a high‑risk client, yet there is no exception request form, board minutes, or ongoing monitoring plan.

6. **Potential cross‑border cash movement (FINMA‑RISK‑05)** – Although the bank is not explicitly identified as a group with international branches, the transaction involves a Russian originator, a GB account, and a French beneficiary. This cross‑border movement could trigger consolidated risk analysis requirements if the bank operates internationally.

Given these multiple gaps—especially the failure to trigger EDD for a high‑risk jurisdiction, the overdue KYC, the sanctions potential, and the lack of an exception process—the transaction is best classified as **High Risk (66‑85)**. The score of 80 reflects the severity of the violations and the proximity to a full regulatory breach.

2. **HKMA‑R‑010** – The originator is from Iran, a high‑risk jurisdiction, and the beneficiary is from the UAE, also considered high risk.

3. **MAS‑WIRE‑01** – For wire transfers above HK$8,000, the ordering institution must capture the originator’s account number, address, and identification number, and the beneficiary’s name and account number. The transaction record lacks the originator’s address and identification number, violating the mandatory data capture requirement. 

4. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is marked as ""potential"", indicating that the originator or beneficiary may be on a sanctions list or have a high‑risk profile. This is a red flag under AML‑CDD‑01 and requires further investigation.

3. **Overdue KYC** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 31/01/2020 and was due on 29/07/2020, making it 3 months overdue. Under **AML‑CDD‑01** and **HKMA‑R‑007**, KYC must be current; an overdue KYC is a compliance gap.
4. **Missing transaction details** – For wire transfers above HK$8,000, **MAS‑WIRE‑01** requires the originator’s address, identification number, and the beneficiary’s address. These fields are not present in the transaction record, constituting a record‑keeping shortfall.
5. **Suspicious transaction** – The transaction was flagged as suspicious and an STR was filed within 3 days.

4. **HKMA‑R‑010** – Because the originator is from a high‑risk jurisdiction, EDD is required.  Although the system records that EDD was performed, there is no evidence of a documented source‑of‑wealth check or a review of the company’s ownership structure.
5. **HKMA‑R‑008** – Beneficial ownership of the domiciliary company is not provided.  For a legal person, the regulator requires a declaration of beneficial owners who hold >25 % of the entity.
6. **HKMA‑R‑012** – The customer is not physically present for identification; the system does not show a secondary ID check or supplementary verification.
7. **MAS‑WIRE‑01** – The required fields (originator/beneficiary account numbers, addresses, etc.) appear to be present, but the presence of swift_f50 and swift_f59 does not guarantee that the originator’s source of funds has been verified.

These gaps amount to a 70–85 % threshold of the regulatory requirements being unmet, placing the transaction in the **High Risk** band (66‑85).

- **HKMA‑R‑007** and **HKMA‑R‑008**: Customer identity and, where applicable, beneficial ownership have been verified.
- **HKMA‑R‑011**: No new high‑risk indicators emerged during monitoring.

The only potential red flag is the *sanctions_screening* field marked ""potential"".  This indicates that the system detected a possible match on a sanctions list, but no definitive match or suspicion has been confirmed, and the transaction has not been flagged as suspicious (suspicion_determined_datetime is null).  Consequently, the transaction remains compliant but warrants a modest review.

Given the absence of any rule violations, missing documentation, or confirmed suspicious activity, the overall risk is low.  The score of 30 reflects a low‑risk classification (26‑45) with a small margin for the potential sanctions concern.

Full CDD (identity verification, beneficial owner identification, risk assessment) is mandatory before execution. While the bank performed EDD, the documentation does not show a completed beneficial‑owner check for the corporate customer.

2. **MAS-CDD-02** – As a legal person, the customer must have its beneficial owners identified and verified. No beneficial‑owner details are provided, constituting a direct violation.

3. **MAS-CDD-04** – The beneficiary resides in Iran, a FATF‑listed high‑risk jurisdiction. EDD is required for any customer or beneficial owner from such a jurisdiction. The transaction is therefore high‑risk, yet the system marks the customer as low‑risk and does not flag the high‑risk jurisdiction.

4. **MAS-CDD-05** – Simplified CDD is only permissible for low‑risk customers who are not from high‑risk jurisdictions and have no suspicion. Because the beneficiary is from a high‑risk jurisdiction, simplified CDD is not allowed, yet the customer is treated as low‑risk.

5. **MAS-WIRE-01 & MAS-WIRE-02** – The transfer message lacks the originator’s and beneficiary’s address and ID number, which are required for cross‑border wire transfers. Missing these details triggers the mandatory investigation or suspension rule (MAS‑WIRE‑02).

6. **MAS-STR-01** – No Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) has been filed, despite the red flags (high‑risk jurisdiction, missing documentation, large amount). Filing an STR would be required.

Given the multiple rule breaches, the high‑risk jurisdiction exposure, and the missing critical documentation, the transaction is assessed as **Very High Risk** (score 86‑100). A score of 92 reflects the severity of the violations and the likelihood that the transaction would be flagged by compliance monitoring systems.

1. **MAS-WIRE-01 & MAS-WIRE-02** – The wire transfer lacks full originator and beneficiary details required by MAS (missing address, ID number, and BIC codes).

2. **MAS-CDD-02** – As a corporate customer, the bank must identify and verify beneficial owners. The provided data does not include any beneficial‑owner information, indicating a potential compliance gap. Even though EDD is marked as performed, the absence of documented beneficial‑owner details is a red flag.

3. **MAS-CDD-03** – The customer is a PEP. EDD has been performed, which satisfies the regulatory requirement, but the presence of a PEP alone increases inherent risk.

4. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 31/05/2021 and was due on 31/05/2023, meaning the KYC is now two years overdue. This overdue status is a significant risk signal under MAS‑CDD‑01 and MAS‑CDD‑05.

5. **Travel Rule** – The transaction is marked as ""travel_rule_complete"": false, indicating that the necessary originator/beneficiary information for cross‑border compliance is incomplete.

6. **No STR filed** – While no suspicious activity has been identified yet, the combination of missing data, PEP status, and overdue KYC means that an STR would likely be required if further investigation uncovered suspicious patterns.

2. **High‑risk jurisdictions** – Originator country CN and beneficiary country AE are both considered high‑risk. Rule AML‑SUS‑04 requires investigation of any transaction involving such jurisdictions.
3. **Large value** – The amount (293,113 EUR) far exceeds the HK$8,000 threshold. Rule MAS‑WIRE‑01 requires full originator and beneficiary details for transfers above this threshold. The record lacks originator address, ID number/DOB, and beneficiary address, constituting a direct violation.
4. **Missing SWIFT fields** – F70 (purpose) and F71 (charges) are absent, despite a purpose code of ""EDU"". This omission violates the completeness requirement of MAS‑WIRE‑01 and increases the risk of structuring or mis‑representation.
5. **Overdue KYC** – The last KYC completion date is 17/10/2021 with a due date of 17/10/2022, meaning the customer’s profile is out‑of‑date. Rule HKMA‑R‑007 requires current identification; the overdue status is a red flag.

The KYC for the customer is overdue (last completed 5/9/2021, due 5/9/2022) and the suitability assessment returned a mismatch, indicating incomplete or inaccurate customer profiling.

2. **Sanctions screening** – The sanctions check returned ""potential"".  Under AML‑SUS‑04 any transaction involving a high‑risk jurisdiction or potential sanctions exposure must be flagged and investigated.  No STR has been filed (str_filed_datetime is null), so the required reporting is missing.

3. **Product complexity and lack of clear purpose** – The transaction is a securities trade with a vague narrative and a purpose code of ""GDS"" that is not clearly defined.  Rule AML‑CDD‑01 requires a clear source of funds and purpose before providing a service; the documentation appears insufficient.

4. **Missing or incomplete documentation** – Although EDD is marked as performed, the presence of a potential sanctions flag, overdue KYC, and a suitability mismatch suggests that the EDD may not have covered all required aspects.

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – The client is classified as ""High"" risk, the originator is from China and the beneficiary from Vietnam, both high‑risk jurisdictions. The transaction amount (€1,207,036.5) exceeds typical high‑risk thresholds (often €1M). The KRI framework would flag this as exceeding tolerance, requiring EDD. However, the transaction record shows ""edd_required"": false, yet EDD was performed, indicating a mismatch between policy and practice. 

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The risk analysis must flag any category that exceeds tolerance or triggers a KRI. Here, the high‑risk client profile, high‑risk jurisdictions, and complex product (fund subscription with VA exposure) all fall into high‑risk categories. The absence of a documented EDD plan for this specific transaction (EDD required false) is a gap. 

3. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", a clear red‑flag that the transaction may involve sanctioned parties. This is not mitigated in the provided data. 

4. **KYC overdue** – The KYC due date (17/04/2024) has passed (transaction date 23/07/2024). The system still indicates ""edd_performed"": true, but the overdue status itself is a compliance gap. 

5. **VA disclosure** – The product has VA exposure but the disclosure was not provided (va_disclosure_provided: false), violating the requirement to disclose VA exposure for high‑risk products. 

6. **FINMA‑RISK‑05** – The transaction is cross‑border (CH to CN/VN) and involves an international channel (FPS HK). For banks with international operations, a consolidated risk analysis is required. The data does not indicate that a consolidated analysis was performed or that the transaction was flagged in the group‑level KRI dashboard. 

Given the combination of high‑risk jurisdictions, high client risk, potential sanctions, overdue KYC, missing VA disclosure, and a mismatch in EDD requirements, the transaction sits in the ""Very High Risk"" band (86‑100).

The risk analysis must flag any high‑risk category for Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).

This is a direct violation of the obligation to flag such categories.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – The transaction involves a high‑risk jurisdiction (VN) and a high‑risk client profile. The KRI framework requires that any exposure above the defined tolerance triggers EDD. Since EDD is not required in the record, the KRI threshold has been breached without the mandated mitigation.

3. **Sanctions Screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", indicating that the beneficiary or originator may be on a sanctions list. This is a critical red‑flag that should have triggered a sanctions‑specific review and possibly a halt of the transaction.

4. **Documentation Gaps** – The swift F70 purpose field is missing, and the swift BICs for ordering and beneficiary institutions are null. While not explicitly required by the listed rules, these gaps reduce the audit trail quality and increase the risk of non‑compliance.

1. **Beneficiary in a high‑risk jurisdiction (Iran)** – This triggers the risk categories in FINMA‑RISK‑01 (client domicile, geography) and FINMA‑RISK‑02 (high‑risk client segments). The presence of a high‑risk jurisdiction should automatically flag the transaction for Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). The data shows ""edd_required"": false while ""edd_performed"": true, indicating a mismatch with the requirement that the risk analysis must flag categories that require EDD. This is a direct violation of FINMA‑RISK‑01.

2. **Cash deposit channel** – Cash transactions are inherently high risk. The transaction is a cash deposit of GBP 111,044.46, which is a substantial amount for a single cash transaction. Under FINMA‑RISK‑02, the KRI for high‑risk cash deposits should be monitored; the absence of a KRI dashboard or evidence of real‑time monitoring suggests a gap in compliance.

3. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 25/12/2022 and was due on 23/6/2023, making it overdue by more than 18 months at the time of booking. FINMA‑RISK‑01 requires that the risk analysis document records data sources used for risk assessment, including up‑to‑date KYC. The overdue status is a red flag and indicates non‑compliance with the KYC requirement.

4. **Sanctions screening “potential”** – The beneficiary country (Iran) is subject to international sanctions. The screening result of ""potential"" indicates a possible sanctions violation. FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑05 require that any high‑risk cross‑border activity trigger EDD and that the consolidated risk analysis capture such exposures. The transaction does not show evidence of an EDD plan or a sanctions‑specific mitigation strategy.

These omissions violate the documentation requirements of FINMA‑RISK‑01, FINMA‑RISK‑02, and FINMA‑RISK‑05.

2. **Incomplete KYC** – The KYC last completed date is 12/1/2025, which is after the transaction date (30/1/2024). This indicates that the customer’s KYC was not up‑to‑date at the time of the transaction, violating the requirement that risk analysis documents include current data sources and that KYC be current.
3. **Cash channel** – Cash withdrawals are inherently higher risk, especially when coupled with a foreign beneficiary. FINMA‑RISK‑01 requires that such high‑risk product/service categories be recorded and monitored.

2. **HKMA‑R‑010** – The originator is from Iran, a high‑risk jurisdiction. EDD is required for any customer from such jurisdictions. Although EDD was performed, the system flagged `edd_required: false`, indicating the EDD trigger was not properly recorded.
3. **MAS‑WIRE‑01** – For wire transfers above HK$8,000, originator and beneficiary details must be captured. These are present, but the rule also requires EDD when the originator or beneficiary is a PEP, suspect, or from a high‑risk jurisdiction. The EDD requirement was not formally triggered.
4. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is “potential”, and the originator’s country (Iran) is subject to U.S. and EU sanctions regimes. This raises a significant sanctions‑risk flag.
5. **AML‑SUS‑04** – The transaction involves a high‑risk jurisdiction and a large amount, meeting the criteria for a suspicious transaction that should be investigated.

Collectively, these gaps and red flags place the transaction in the **High‑Risk** category (66‑85) but, due to the sanctions‑risk and overdue KYC, it leans toward the upper end of that band, warranting a score of 88.

2. **Potential sanctions exposure** – The sanctions screening result is ""potential"", indicating that the originator or beneficiary may be on a sanctions list or have a high‑risk profile.  Under AML‑CDD‑01 and AML‑SUS‑04, any potential sanctions exposure mandates enhanced scrutiny and, if unresolved, an STR.

3. **High‑risk jurisdiction** – The beneficiary is located in China, a high‑risk jurisdiction under HKMA guidance.  AML‑SUS‑04 requires flagging and investigation of any transaction involving high‑risk jurisdictions, regardless of amount.

4. **Missing STR** – No suspicious transaction report (STR) has been filed (str_filed_datetime is null).  The combination of potential sanctions, high‑risk jurisdiction, and overdue KYC should have triggered an STR under AML‑SUS‑04.

5. **Other minor gaps** – The swift F70 purpose field is null, and while the transaction is a cash deposit below the HK$8,000 threshold, the presence of cross‑border elements and potential sanctions still elevate the risk.

1. **High‑risk jurisdiction exposure (FINMA‑RISK‑01 & FINMA‑RISK‑05)** – The originator is based in Iran (IR), a country subject to extensive sanctions and considered a high‑risk jurisdiction by FINMA. The beneficiary is in China (CN), also flagged for AML/CFT concerns. This cross‑border exposure should trigger the consolidated risk analysis and, per FINMA‑RISK‑05, any high‑risk cross‑border activity must trigger Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). The transaction is marked as ""edd_required"": false, yet EDD was performed, indicating a mismatch and a potential regulatory violation.

2. **Sanctions screening flagged as ""potential"" (FINMA‑RISK‑01 & FINMA‑RISK‑05)** – The presence of a potential sanctions match is a clear red flag. Under FINMA rules, any sanctions screening alert must be investigated and, if confirmed, the transaction must be blocked or reported. The fact that the transaction proceeded without a definitive sanctions clearance is a direct breach of the regulatory framework.

3. **Outdated KYC (FINMA‑RISK‑01 & FINMA‑RISK‑02)** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 13/7/2020 and was due on 13/7/2021, meaning the KYC is now overdue by more than a year. This violates the requirement to maintain up‑to‑date customer information and undermines the risk assessment.

4. **Potentially suspicious purpose and narrative (FINMA‑RISK‑01)** – The swift_f70_purpose field contains the phrase ""Bit happy oil stand and adult."" and the narrative is vague. While not a definitive violation, it adds to the suspicion profile and indicates that the transaction may not have a clear legitimate purpose.

5. **Mismatch between EDD requirement and execution (FINMA‑RISK‑02 & FINMA‑RISK‑03)** – The system indicates that EDD was performed even though the transaction was not flagged as requiring EDD. This inconsistency suggests a failure in the exception process and the risk tolerance framework.

Given these multiple violations and red flags, the transaction falls into the ""Very High Risk"" category (86‑100) with a score of 90. The score reflects the severity of the sanctions risk, jurisdictional exposure, KYC lapse, and procedural inconsistencies, all of which are critical breaches of FINMA AML obligations.",0.0053065564,0,

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The transaction involves a cross‑border securities trade (originator DE, beneficiary JP) and a high‑risk client (corporate, high risk rating). The bank’s risk analysis must flag such categories for EDD. Although EDD was performed, the presence of a high‑risk client and cross‑border exposure still triggers the risk signal.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – Key risk indicators for high‑risk client segments and jurisdictions are expected to monitor exposure limits. The transaction amount (SGD 285 036.5) is substantial for a corporate client with a high risk rating. Without explicit tolerance limits provided, the transaction likely approaches or exceeds the 70–85 % threshold for high‑risk exposure, warranting a high‑risk classification.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – The transaction is not explicitly approved via an exception process, but the high‑risk profile and sanctions potential would normally require an exception request with an EDD plan. The absence of documented exception approval is a gap.

4. **Sanctions Screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", indicating a possible match with sanctions lists. This is a red flag that could trigger a violation if not resolved.

5. **KYC Overdue** – The KYC was last completed on 14/6/2020 and was due on 11/12/2020, meaning the customer’s KYC is overdue by several months. This violates the requirement for up‑to‑date KYC data and increases the risk of non‑compliance.

6. **Other Controls** – While the transaction meets several controls (EDD performed, suitability assessed, travel rule complete, SWIFT F50/F59 present), the combination of high‑risk client, cross‑border nature, sanctions potential, and overdue KYC pushes the risk into the high‑risk band (66‑85). The presence of multiple red flags and the lack of explicit documentation for exception approval justify a score near the upper end of this band.

1. **Missing originator details** – The SWIFT MT103 lacks the originator account field (swift_f50_present = false). MAS‑WIRE‑01 requires originator information for transfers above HK$8,000, and the absence of this data is a red flag even for lower‑value transfers, indicating incomplete transaction documentation.
2. **Overdue KYC** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 17/9/2019 with a due date of 16/9/2020, meaning the KYC is now more than five years out‑of‑date. AML‑CDD‑01 mandates up‑to‑date customer identification before any service; an overdue KYC violates this obligation.
3. **Channel/ product mismatch** – The transaction is recorded as a cash channel but the product is a wire transfer. This inconsistency suggests potential mis‑classification or procedural error, which could mask cash‑in‑to‑wire flows that are harder to trace.
4. **No ordering institution BIC** – The ordering_institution_bic field is null, preventing the institution from verifying the originator’s bank and its AML controls. This omission contravenes standard due diligence practices.

These issues do not constitute a full regulatory violation but represent significant compliance gaps that warrant monitoring and remediation. Accordingly, the risk is classified as medium (≈55) rather than low or high.

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The risk analysis must flag any category that requires EDD. This transaction involves a high‑risk client profile and a beneficiary in Vietnam (a high‑risk jurisdiction). The system marked EDD as not required, yet EDD was performed, indicating a failure to flag the high‑risk category. 

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – KRIs should trigger EDD when exposure to a high‑risk category exceeds tolerance limits. The transaction amount (£422,459.83) is likely above typical tolerance thresholds for high‑risk clients or jurisdictions, and the KRI dashboard would have shown a breach. 

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – No exception request or board approval is documented for this high‑risk transaction, violating the requirement for an exception process when a transaction falls outside tolerance. 

4. **FINMA‑RISK‑05** – The transaction is cross‑border (GB → VN). A consolidated risk analysis at the group level is mandatory for such activity, and the lack of evidence of a group‑level KRI or approval suggests non‑compliance. 

5. Additional red flags: 
   - Beneficiary country Vietnam is a high‑risk jurisdiction. 
   - KYC was last completed on 7/11/2022 and was due on 6/5/2023, i.e., overdue. 
   - Suspicion was determined after the booking (2025‑08‑31), indicating that the transaction was flagged as suspicious post‑hoc. 
   - No sanctions screening was performed, despite the high‑risk jurisdiction.

3. **KYC overdue** – The last KYC completion date (21/02/2022) is more than 6 months past the due date (21/02/2024). This indicates that the institution has not refreshed the customer profile within the required timeframe, violating the implicit requirement of FINMA‑RISK‑01 to use up‑to‑date data for risk assessment.

Given these gaps, the transaction falls into the ""High Risk"" band (66‑85) according to the scoring guidelines. The score of 75 reflects a substantial risk exposure that is close to violating regulatory thresholds but not yet a clear rule breach.

2. **MAS‑CDD‑01 (High‑risk customer)** – The client risk profile is marked ""High"" and the transaction is a complex fund subscription, which falls under the high‑risk category for CDD.
3. **MAS‑CDD‑01 (Potential sanctions)** – The sanctions screening result is ""potential"", indicating a possible sanctions hit. Under MAS rules, any potential sanctions flag requires heightened scrutiny and usually an STR.
4. **MAS‑CDD‑01 (Missing or incomplete CDD data)** – Although F50/F59 are present, the narrative and purpose code are inconsistent (purpose code ""EDU"" vs narrative about a military production house), suggesting incomplete or misleading information.
5. **MAS‑STR‑01 (Suspicious transaction)** – The inconsistency between purpose code and narrative, combined with the potential sanctions hit, constitutes a suspicious transaction that should trigger an STR. No STR has been filed.
6. **MAS‑MONT‑01 (Ongoing monitoring)** – The transaction is a single large, complex fund subscription with no clear business rationale, raising a red flag for ongoing monitoring.
7. **MAS‑CDD‑06 (Digital token rule not applicable)** – Not relevant, but the presence of a cheque channel means the wire‑transfer rules (MAS‑WIRE‑01/02) do not apply.

1. **Sanctions screening ‘potential’** – This indicates a possible match with a sanctions list. Under FINMA‑RISK‑01 the risk analysis must flag any category that requires Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). Although EDD was performed, the potential match itself is a key risk indicator that should have triggered a higher level of scrutiny.
2. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 9/6/2020 and the due date was 6/12/2020, meaning the KYC is now more than 3 years overdue. FINMA‑RISK‑02 requires that any exposure to a high‑risk client or jurisdiction that exceeds tolerance thresholds triggers EDD. An overdue KYC is a clear sign that the client’s risk profile may have changed, and the current risk rating (Low) conflicts with the client risk profile (High).
3. **High client risk profile vs. low risk rating** – The system records the client as ‘High’ risk, yet the risk rating is ‘Low’. This mismatch suggests that the risk assessment may not be up‑to‑date, which is a compliance gap under FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑02.
4. **Cash channel** – While cash deposits are generally low‑risk, the transaction is a single cash deposit of GBP 1,297.89. The daily cash total equals the transaction amount, which is below typical thresholds for high‑risk cash activity. However, combined with the sanctions and KYC issues, it elevates the overall risk.

Given these factors, the transaction does not breach any rule outright but sits in the medium‑risk band (46‑65) due to the sanctions potential, overdue KYC, and risk profile mismatch. Therefore a risk score of 60 is assigned.",0.003847232,0,

1. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 5/4/2021 and was due on 5/4/2023, yet the transaction occurred in June 2024. This violates HKMA‑R‑007 (customer identification and verification) and raises a red flag for regulatory compliance.
2. **Missing originator/beneficiary address** – MAS‑WIRE‑02 requires recording the originator’s address and the beneficiary’s address for all wire transfers, even those below HK$8,000. The transaction record lacks both addresses, and MAS‑WIRE‑03 mandates that missing data be obtained or the relationship restricted. Failure to do so is a compliance breach.
3. **Missing SWIFT F70 purpose field** – The F70 field, which should contain the transaction purpose, is null. While not explicitly flagged in the rule set, its absence indicates incomplete transaction documentation.
4. **Missing BICs** – Both ordering and beneficiary institution BICs are null. Although not explicitly required for low‑value transfers, the absence of these identifiers can impede audit trails and regulatory reporting.
5. **No suspicious activity flagged** – The transaction has no STR filed, no suspicion determined, and sanctions screening returned ""none"", which mitigates risk.

Balancing the presence of these compliance gaps against the lack of high‑value, high‑risk, or suspicious characteristics places the transaction in the **Medium Risk** band (46‑65).

2. **Missing Source‑of‑Funds / Purpose Documentation** – The purpose code is “FAM” with a vague narrative, and no explicit source‑of‑funds evidence is attached. HKMA‑R‑009 and HKMA‑R‑010 require source‑of‑wealth verification for high‑risk customers; the absence of this documentation is a red flag.
3. **Beneficial Ownership Unclear** – For a corporate customer, HKMA‑R‑008 mandates identification of beneficial owners over 25%. No beneficial‑owner data is provided, creating a potential gap in the due‑diligence chain.

3. **Sanctions screening “potential”** – The transaction triggered a potential sanctions match. Under AML‑SUS‑04, any suspicious transaction must be investigated and an STR filed; the STR was filed, but the potential match indicates a higher risk profile.
4. **Cross‑border to high‑risk jurisdictions** – Originator in China (CN) and beneficiary in Russia (RU) are considered high‑risk jurisdictions. Rules AML‑SUS‑04 and MAS‑WIRE‑01 (for wire transfers) highlight the need for heightened scrutiny of such flows.

- **MAS-CDD-03**: Although the customer is not a PEP, the client risk profile is marked ""High"" and the product is complex, which would normally trigger EDD. EDD was performed, but the expired KYC undermines the adequacy of that EDD.
- **MAS-CDD-05**: Simplified CDD is only allowed for low‑risk customers. The customer’s profile is high risk, so simplified CDD would be inappropriate; the bank has performed EDD, but the expired KYC still represents a compliance gap.

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – The customer is rated ""High"" and the transaction is cross‑border to Hong Kong, a jurisdiction that is typically considered high risk. The KRI for high‑risk clients is exceeded (the transaction is 20 000 CHF, above many banks’ tolerance limits for such clients). EDD is required (edd_required = true) but has not been performed (edd_performed = false), constituting a direct violation of the rule.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The risk analysis must flag any category that requires EDD. The presence of a high‑risk customer, cross‑border flow, and a ""potential"" sanctions screening result indicates that the risk analysis should have identified this transaction as high risk. The fact that EDD was not carried out suggests the bank’s controls are not fully operational.

3. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", which is a red flag under FINMA guidelines. A potential sanctions match requires immediate investigation and possible reporting.

4. **KYC and identity verification** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 11/7/2022 and was due on 7/1/2023, meaning the KYC is now overdue. Additionally, cash_id_verified is false, indicating that the customer’s identity has not been verified for this transaction. Both are non‑compliant with the requirement to maintain up‑to‑date KYC and identity verification for high‑risk clients.

5. **SWIFT data** – While the travel rule is complete and F50/F59 are present, the purpose code ""TAX"" and the F70 field ""Material prevent to walk."" are ambiguous and could raise suspicion under the transaction monitoring system.

Given these multiple gaps—non‑performed EDD, potential sanctions match, overdue KYC, missing identity verification, and cross‑border exposure to a high‑risk jurisdiction—the transaction sits in the ""High Risk"" band (66‑85). The score of 80 reflects the severity of the violations and the likelihood that the transaction would trigger a regulatory investigation if not remedied.

1. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 28/3/2021 and was due 28/3/2022, exceeding the acceptable renewal period. Under FINMA‑RISK‑02, a KYC lapse should trigger an EDD review, indicating a breach of the risk tolerance for client onboarding.
2. **Cash ID not verified** – For a cash deposit, identity verification is mandatory. The absence of a verified cash ID is a direct violation of the controls outlined in FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑02, which require documented verification for cash‑related products.
3. **Product complexity** – The transaction is flagged as ""product_complex: true"". FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑02 require enhanced due diligence for any product that increases inherent risk. The fact that EDD was performed but not explicitly required (edd_required: false) suggests a potential gap in the risk‑tolerance framework.
4. **High‑risk jurisdiction originator** – The originator is based in Hong Kong, which is often classified as a higher‑risk jurisdiction for AML purposes. This triggers the risk signals in FINMA‑RISK‑01 (new or increased exposure to high‑risk jurisdictions) and FINMA‑RISK‑02 (KRI monitoring for high‑risk client segments).
5. **No sanctions screening** – While the transaction shows ""sanctions_screening: none"", the lack of a sanctions check for a cross‑border transaction from a high‑risk jurisdiction is a compliance gap.

These factors collectively place the transaction in the **Medium Risk** band (46‑65). The score of 55 reflects the presence of multiple moderate red flags without any outright rule violations that would push it into the High or Very High risk categories. The transaction is not fully compliant with the documented risk‑analysis and due‑diligence requirements, but it does not yet trigger a full EDD or exception process under the current information.

2. **MAS-CDD-06** – Not applicable (digital token transaction). 

3. **MAS-STR-01** – The sanctions screening result is ""potential"", a clear red flag. Under MAS‑STR‑01 a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) must be filed for any transaction suspected of money‑laundering or terrorism financing. No STR has been filed (str_filed_datetime is null), constituting a regulatory violation.

4. **MAS-CDD-03 / MAS-CDD-04** – Not applicable (customer is not a PEP and is not from a high‑risk jurisdiction). 

5. **MAS-CDD-05** – The customer is classified as low risk, but the presence of a potential sanctions hit overrides the simplified CDD exception.

6. **MAS-REC-01** – Record‑keeping appears adequate (records are presumably retained for five years), but the missing updated KYC and lack of an STR represent incomplete documentation.

7. **MAS-MON-01** – No evidence of ongoing monitoring failures, but the transaction’s complexity (product_complex = true, product_has_va_exposure = true) and the lack of a current KYC increase the monitoring burden.

Overall, the transaction is high risk (score 66‑85) because key documentation (updated KYC) is missing and a required STR has not been filed for a potential sanctions hit. The EDD performed mitigates some risk, but the regulatory gaps keep the score at 80.

2. **High‑Risk Client Profile** – The client is classified as ""High"" risk. Under FINMA‑RISK‑02, high‑risk clients must have a defined tolerance limit and associated KRIs. A 20 000 CHF transaction likely exceeds typical tolerance thresholds for a high‑risk client, triggering the need for EDD.

4. **Missing Cash‑ID Verification** – For a cash deposit (product_type: ""cash_deposit""), cash‑ID verification is a key control. The field ""cash_id_verified"": false shows this control was not executed, violating FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑03.

1. **AML-CDD-01** – The customer is a PEP and the KYC was last completed on 9/7/2021, two years past the due date (9/7/2023). The required CDD (identity, source of funds, purpose) is therefore incomplete and overdue. The transaction amount (HK$3.5M) is well above the typical threshold for routine CDD.
2. **HKMA-R-009** – Any transaction of 120,000 HK$ or more requires CDD before processing. This transaction (HK$3.5M) is far above that threshold, yet the required CDD has not been performed.
3. **HKMA-R-010** – The originator is a PEP, mandating Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). The record shows ""edd_required"": true but ""edd_performed"": false, indicating a clear breach of the EDD obligation.
4. **AML-SUS-04** – The transaction is flagged as unusual (large cross‑border amount, PEP originator, high‑risk jurisdictions CH and DE). The system has not filed an STR (str_filed_datetime is null) and no internal investigation logs are present.
5. **Additional red flags** – The transaction is a cheque (non‑wire) but still involves a large amount and cross‑border movement, which is a high‑risk scenario under the HKMA/SFC regime. The customer’s risk profile is marked ""High"" and the product is complex, further amplifying the risk.

Given the combination of overdue KYC, missing EDD, failure to file an STR, and the high‑value cross‑border nature of the transaction, the risk score is positioned in the 86‑100 range, specifically 90.

1. **High‑risk jurisdiction** – Both originator and beneficiary are from Iran (IR), a high‑risk country for sanctions and money‑laundering.

The transaction shows ""edd_required"": false, yet ""edd_performed"": true, indicating a mismatch between the risk analysis and the actual due‑diligence requirement.

2. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is ""potential"", which is a clear red flag. FINMA‑RISK‑01 requires that any category exceeding tolerance or triggering a key risk indicator (KRI) must be subject to EDD. The fact that EDD was performed but not formally required suggests the risk analysis failed to capture the sanctions exposure.

3. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 02/05/2022 with a due date of 29/10/2022, meaning the KYC is now overdue. FINMA‑RISK‑02 mandates that KRIs monitor the percentage of high‑risk clients exceeding tolerance; an overdue KYC for a high‑risk jurisdiction should have triggered a KRI alert and an EDD plan.

4. **Large transaction amount** – The value of 1,518,111.79 SGD (~1.1 M CHF) is substantial. While not exceeding typical thresholds, combined with the high‑risk jurisdiction and sanctions potential, it pushes the transaction into the 85–95 % risk threshold range.

5. **Missing documentation** – The transaction lacks explicit evidence of a documented EDD plan or exception approval, which would be required under FINMA‑RISK‑03 if the transaction had to be approved outside tolerance. The absence of a documented EDD plan for a high‑risk transaction is a compliance gap.

1. **KYC overdue (AML‑CDD‑01)** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 25/05/2020 and was due on 25/05/2021, making it four years overdue. This violates the requirement to keep customer information up‑to‑date.
2. **Potential sanctions risk (HKMA‑R‑008 / AML‑SUS‑04)** – The beneficiary is a Russian resident, a high‑risk jurisdiction. The sanctions screening result is ""potential"", indicating a possible sanctions violation. No STR has been filed, which is a red flag for a high‑risk jurisdiction.
3. **Missing beneficial‑owner information (HKMA‑R‑008)** – The customer is a domiciliary company with a high risk rating, yet no beneficial‑owner details are provided. This is a compliance gap for a legal person.
4. **Inconsistent risk assessment** – The system records the customer as ""High"" risk but the client risk profile is ""Low"". This inconsistency suggests a lapse in risk‑rating procedures.
5. **Missing SWIFT purpose field (AML‑CDD‑01)** – The SWIFT F70 purpose field is null, while the purpose code is ""INV"". Although the transaction is cash, the missing field indicates incomplete transaction documentation.
6. **No STR filed (AML‑SUS‑04)** – Despite the high‑risk jurisdiction and potential sanctions flag, no suspicious transaction report has been filed.

On the positive side, EDD was performed (HKMA‑R‑010, MAS‑EDD‑01) and the customer’s ID was verified (cash_id_verified = true). The transaction shows no structuring or rapid movement of funds, and the travel rule is complete. These factors mitigate but do not eliminate the identified risks.

2. **AML‑CDD‑01** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 1/6/2020 and the due date was 28/11/2020, meaning the KYC is expired. Although a CDD record exists, it is no longer current, violating the obligation to keep customer information up‑to‑date.

2. **MAS-CDD-02** – The customer is a domiciliary company, and the transaction record does not provide any evidence of beneficial owner identification or verification.

The key gaps identified are:

1. **Expired KYC** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 16/11/2021 and was due on 16/11/2022, so it is no longer current.  Under **HKMA‑R‑009** (CDD for any transaction ≥HK$120,000) and **HKMA‑R‑007** (identification of all customers), the institution must obtain updated identification and source‑of‑funds information before processing the transfer.

2. **Incomplete Travel Rule compliance** – The transaction is cross‑border (SG → JP).  **MAS‑WIRE‑01** requires the originator’s account number, address, ID, and the beneficiary’s name and account number to be captured.  The provided data lacks the originator’s address and any ID reference, and the travel rule is marked as incomplete.  This constitutes a breach of the travel‑rule requirement.

3. **Missing originator address and ID details** – Even though the swift F50 and F59 fields are present, the absence of the originator’s address and ID means the institution cannot satisfy the mandatory data capture under **MAS‑WIRE‑01** and **MAS‑WIRE‑03**.

4. **No EDD triggered** – The customer is not a PEP, high‑risk jurisdiction, or known suspect, so **HKMA‑R‑010** and **MAS‑EDD‑01** do not apply.  However, the lack of current KYC and incomplete travel‑rule data elevate the risk.

5. **High transaction value** – The amount is well above the HK$8,000 threshold, so any failure to meet the above obligations is considered a significant compliance breach.

Given these red flags—expired KYC, incomplete travel‑rule data, and missing originator address/ID—the transaction falls into the **High‑Risk** band (66‑85).  A score of 75 reflects the severity of the compliance gaps while acknowledging that no outright regulatory violations (e.g., sanctions or PEP status) are present.

2. **Large occasional transaction (HKMA‑R‑009)** – The amount of GBP 198,920.57 exceeds the HK$120,000 threshold for occasional transactions. The rule mandates CDD before such a transaction; although EDD was performed, the overdue KYC undermines the adequacy of that due‑diligence.

3. **Missing source‑of‑funds evidence** – The transaction record contains no documentation of the origin of the funds (e.g., salary slips, invoices, or other source‑of‑wealth evidence). For a securities trade of this magnitude, the absence of source‑of‑funds documentation is a significant compliance gap.

4. **High client risk profile** – The client is classified as “High” risk, and the transaction is a large, non‑routine payment. Even though the customer is not a PEP and the jurisdictions involved (DE, FR) are not high‑risk, the combination of a high‑risk profile and a large, unverified transaction elevates the overall risk.

These factors collectively place the transaction in the **High‑Risk (66‑85) range**. The score of 70 reflects the severity of the KYC lapse, the large transaction size, and the lack of source‑of‑funds documentation, while acknowledging that no explicit PEP status or high‑risk jurisdiction is involved.

3. **MAS‑CDD‑01** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 26/03/2020 and was due on 26/03/2022, meaning the CDD records are expired. Conducting a transaction without up‑to‑date CDD is a violation of the MAS notice 626 requirement.

4. **Missing Documentation** – The risk analysis document, KRI dashboard, and board approval log are not referenced in the transaction record, implying that the transaction may not have been fully integrated into the bank’s risk monitoring framework (FINMA‑RISK‑01, FINMA‑RISK‑04). 

5. **Exception Process Not Engaged** – No exception request or board approval is documented, despite the transaction exceeding the normal risk tolerance for a low‑risk customer with overdue KYC (FINMA‑RISK‑03). 

Given these factors—overdue KYC, potential sanctions exposure, high transaction value, and missing documentation—the transaction falls into the **High Risk** category (66‑85). A score of 75 reflects the severity of the compliance gaps and the potential regulatory consequences under FINMA.

1. **Missing Beneficial Owner Information (MAS‑CDD‑02)** – The customer is a domiciliary company, a legal person that requires identification of ultimate beneficial owners. No such information is present in the record, constituting a missing key document.
2. **KYC Over‑due (MAS‑CDD‑01 & MAS‑REC‑01)** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 9/2/2022 and was due on 9/2/2024, yet the transaction occurs on 16/12/2024. This overdue KYC violates the requirement to maintain up‑to‑date CDD records.

1. **MAS-CDD-01** – The cross‑border wire transfer of USD 5,905.10 exceeds the S1,500 threshold, requiring full CDD before execution. While KYC was completed, the required identity documents (ID card/passport) for both originator and beneficiary are missing, and no address or ID numbers are provided in the transfer message. This constitutes a key documentation shortfall.

2. **MAS-WIRE-01** – The rule mandates that all cross‑border wire messages include the originator and beneficiary name, account number, address, and ID number. The transaction lacks the address and ID number fields, violating the requirement.

3. **MAS-WIRE-02** – Because the transfer lacks required originator/beneficiary information, the bank should have rejected, suspended, or investigated the transfer and filed an STR. No STR was filed, creating a regulatory breach.

4. **MAS-CDD-04** – The originator is from Iran, a FATF‑designated high‑risk jurisdiction. EDD is mandatory for such customers. Although EDD is marked as performed, the missing ID documentation undermines the completeness of the EDD.

5. **MAS-CDD-03** – Not applicable (customer is not a PEP or close associate).

6. **MAS-CDD-05** – Not applicable (customer is high risk, not low risk).

7. **MAS-CDD-06** – Not applicable (no digital token transaction).

8. **MAS-MON-01** – Ongoing monitoring is required for high‑risk customers; the lack of complete originator/beneficiary data hampers effective monitoring.

9. **MAS-STR-01** – The missing information and potential suspicious nature of the transfer should have triggered an STR, which was not filed.

Overall, the transaction is high risk (score 82) due to missing critical identity documentation, failure to file an STR, and the high‑risk originator jurisdiction. The bank should immediately remediate the gaps and consider re‑evaluating the transaction under enhanced due diligence.

1. **HKMA‑R‑009 (Large‑value transaction CDD)** – The amount (USD 243,800 ≈ HK$1.9 M) exceeds the HK$120,000 threshold, so CDD must be performed. The customer’s KYC was last completed on 25/08/2022 and was due on 25/08/2023, i.e., it is now overdue. This constitutes a breach of the CDD requirement.

2. **Travel Rule (SWIFT F59, F70, F71)** – The transaction is cross‑border (originator CH, beneficiary TH). The travel‑rule data is incomplete: `swift_f59_present` is false and `travel_rule_complete` is false. Under HKMA/SFC guidance, the full set of travel‑rule fields must be captured for any cross‑border wire. The missing data is a compliance gap.

3. **MAS‑WIRE‑01** – While the required originator/beneficiary details are present, the rule also stipulates that EDD is required if the originator or beneficiary is a PEP, a known suspect, or a foreign entity with limited regulatory oversight. Thailand is considered a high‑risk jurisdiction for money‑laundering purposes in many jurisdictions, and the beneficiary country is TH. The absence of a sanctions screening (value: ""none"") and the lack of a high‑risk jurisdiction flag mean the transaction could be flagged for EDD under MAS‑WIRE‑01.

4. **AML‑SUS‑04** – The transaction is large, cross‑border, and involves a potentially high‑risk jurisdiction. These are key risk signals for suspicious activity. The lack of a completed travel‑rule and overdue KYC increase the likelihood that the transaction would be flagged for investigation.

5. **Other gaps** – No evidence of a valid government‑issued ID or proof of address for the originator is provided in the transaction record. While the system indicates that EDD was performed, the overdue KYC and missing travel‑rule data suggest that the due diligence may be incomplete.

Given these multiple red‑flags (overdue KYC, incomplete travel‑rule data, large cross‑border amount to a high‑risk jurisdiction), the transaction falls into the **High‑Risk** category (66‑85). The score of 78 reflects the severity of the compliance gaps and the potential regulatory penalties that could arise if the transaction is not remedied.

The transaction amount (€272,282.40) is well above typical tolerance limits for a single high‑risk client, suggesting a KRI breach.

2. **Product & Channel** – An FX conversion executed via cheque is a higher‑risk product/ channel combination. FINMA‑RISK‑01 requires that the risk analysis records this inherent risk and that controls are in place. The lack of a documented KRI dashboard for FX‑cheque transactions indicates a potential gap.

3. **Sanctions Screening** – The screening result is marked as ""potential"", implying a possible sanctions violation. FINMA‑RISK‑05 mandates that any high‑risk cross‑border activity identified in the consolidated analysis triggers EDD. Although EDD was performed, the screening result was not resolved, leaving a red flag.

4. **Documentation** – While KYC, SOW, and EDD records exist, key controls are missing: no BICs for the ordering or beneficiary institutions, no explicit evidence that the sanctions screening issue was cleared, and no KRI dashboard showing real‑time compliance status. These omissions align with the ""key docs missing"" criterion for a high‑risk score.

5. **Exception Process** – FINMA‑RISK‑03 requires an exception request and board approval if a transaction exceeds tolerance. No evidence of an exception request or mitigation plan is provided.

1. **Sanctions screening – ""potential""**: A potential sanctions match is a key risk indicator that should trigger EDD and possibly an exception process (FINMA‑RISK‑03). The system indicates EDD was performed, but the flag was not reflected in the risk tolerance or KRI dashboard, suggesting a compliance gap.
2. **KYC timing**: The KYC last completed date is set to 6/4/2025, a future date relative to the booking date (30/8/2024). This indicates that the KYC data may not be current or properly recorded, violating the requirement to base risk assessments on up‑to‑date information (FINMA‑RISK‑01).
3. **EDD performed despite no trigger**: The transaction shows ""edd_required"": false but ""edd_performed"": true. Performing EDD when not required can indicate procedural inconsistencies and may mask other compliance issues.
4. **Channel mismatch**: The transaction is recorded as a cheque but uses a wire‑transfer product type (MT103). While not inherently high risk, this inconsistency could signal data entry errors or misclassification.

1. **Beneficiary in a high‑risk jurisdiction (RU)** – According to FINMA‑RISK‑02, exposure to high‑risk jurisdictions must be monitored via KRIs and, if thresholds are exceeded, EDD must be triggered. The transaction is not flagged for EDD (edd_required: false) despite the beneficiary country being Russia, a known high‑risk jurisdiction.
2. **Potential sanctions violation** – The sanctions screening result is ""potential"". FINMA‑RISK‑01 requires that any risk category exceeding tolerance or triggering a KRI must be flagged for EDD. The presence of a potential sanctions match without a documented EDD plan indicates a compliance gap.
3. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 09/07/2020 and was due on 09/07/2021, meaning the KYC is now overdue. This violates the requirement that KYC data be up‑to‑date for risk assessment.
4. **Mismatch between EDD requirement and execution** – The system records ""edd_required"": false but ""edd_performed"": true. This inconsistency suggests that the transaction was processed without a formal EDD trigger, contrary to FINMA‑RISK‑02 and FINMA‑RISK‑03.
5. **Missing exception documentation** – If the transaction had exceeded the risk tolerance for the high‑risk jurisdiction, an exception request with mitigation measures and board approval would be required (FINMA‑RISK‑03). No such documentation is present.

Given these multiple gaps—high‑risk jurisdiction exposure, potential sanctions match, overdue KYC, and inconsistent EDD handling—the transaction falls into the ""Very High Risk"" band (86‑100). The score of 90 reflects the severity of the violations and the likelihood that the transaction would trigger a regulatory investigation if not corrected.

The system indicates `edd_required: false` yet the transaction is above the threshold, constituting a clear breach.

2. **MAS-CDD-04** – The beneficiary resides in Iran, a jurisdiction listed by FATF as high‑risk. EDD is mandatory for any customer or beneficial owner from such a jurisdiction. The record shows `edd_performed: true` but `edd_required: false`, indicating a mismatch and a failure to apply the mandated EDD.

3. **MAS-CDD-02** – The customer is a corporate entity. The regulatory framework requires identification of all beneficial owners for legal persons unless exempt. No beneficial‑owner information is present in the transaction record, violating this rule.

4. **MAS-CDD-05** – Simplified CDD is only permissible for low‑risk customers who are not from high‑risk jurisdictions and have no suspicion of money‑laundering. This transaction involves a high‑risk jurisdiction (Iran) and a large amount, so simplified CDD is inappropriate.

5. **MAS-WIRE-01 / MAS-WIRE-02** – While the originator and beneficiary details are present, the transfer is to a high‑risk jurisdiction and the transaction is large. The system should have flagged this as high risk and potentially rejected or investigated the transfer.

6. **MAS-STR-01** – No Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) has been filed, despite the red flags (high‑risk jurisdiction, expired KYC, missing beneficial‑owner data). Failure to file an STR when warranted is a regulatory violation.

2. **MAS-CDD-04** – The beneficiary is located in Iran (IR), a FATF‑listed high‑risk jurisdiction. EDD is mandatory for any customer or beneficial owner from such a jurisdiction, yet the record shows `edd_required: false` (though `edd_performed: true`). This mismatch indicates non‑compliance with the EDD obligation.
3. **MAS-CDD-05** – Simplified CDD is only permissible for low‑risk customers not from high‑risk jurisdictions. Because the beneficiary is from a high‑risk jurisdiction, simplified CDD is not allowed, yet the transaction is treated as low risk.
4. **MAS-WIRE-01 / MAS-WIRE-02** – The transfer is cross‑border (originator DE, beneficiary IR). The required BICs for ordering and beneficiary institutions are missing (`ordering_institution_bic` and `beneficiary_institution_bic` are null). This omission triggers the reject/suspend rule and constitutes a red flag.
5. **Sanctions Screening** – No sanctions screening was performed (`sanctions_screening: ""none""`). A beneficiary in Iran is subject to comprehensive sanctions, so the absence of screening is a clear violation.
6. **MAS-STR-01** – Given the above red flags (overdue KYC, high‑risk jurisdiction, missing BICs, no sanctions screening), the transaction should have triggered an STR. The absence of an STR filing (`str_filed_datetime: null`) further indicates non‑compliance.

1. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 01/05/2023 and was due on 30/04/2024, yet the transaction occurs on 02/05/2025. This exceeds the typical KYC review cycle and violates the implicit requirement in FINMA‑RISK‑01 that risk analysis must be based on up‑to‑date data. 
2. **High client risk profile** – The customer is rated ‘Medium’ overall but the client risk profile is ‘High’. This mismatch indicates that the internal risk assessment may not be aligned with the actual exposure, a gap that FINMA‑RISK‑02 expects to be flagged by KRIs. 
3. **Sanctions screening ‘potential’** – The screening result is not a clean pass; it is flagged as ‘potential’. Under FINMA‑RISK‑05, any high‑risk cross‑border activity or sanctions exposure should trigger EDD. Although EDD was performed, the system marked it as not required, suggesting a procedural inconsistency. 
4. **Cross‑border nature** – The transaction is from Japan to Germany via SWIFT. While Japan is not a high‑risk jurisdiction, the cross‑border element combined with the sanctions flag increases the risk profile. 
5. **Documentation gaps** – The transaction lacks explicit evidence of a written risk analysis for this specific exposure, and the STR was filed only a day after the suspicion was determined, which is acceptable but indicates a reactive rather than proactive approach.

2. **Sanctions screening flagged** – The transaction is marked as ""potential"" under sanctions screening. Under Rule AML‑SUS‑04, any suspicious transaction must be investigated and an STR filed. No STR has been filed (str_filed_datetime is null), constituting a regulatory breach.
3. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 24/01/2021 and was due on 24/01/2022, making it overdue by over three years. This violates the ongoing due diligence requirement and increases the risk of non‑compliance.
4. **High‑value transaction** – The amount (425,986.19 GBP) far exceeds the HK$8,000 threshold for wire transfers, requiring full originator/beneficiary data capture and EDD. While the required fields are present, the combination of high value, high‑risk jurisdiction, and sanctions flag elevates the risk.
5. **VA exposure** – The product has virtual‑asset exposure (product_has_va_exposure = true). Rule MAS‑VA‑LIC‑01 and MAS‑VA‑RO‑02 mandate fit‑and‑proper assessments and EDD for VA providers. The disclosure is provided, but the presence of a high‑risk beneficiary and sanctions flag suggests that the VA component may not be fully compliant.

These red flags collectively place the transaction in the **High‑Risk (85–95%)** band, resulting in a risk score of 88. The score reflects the severity of the sanctions and KYC gaps, the high‑risk jurisdiction, and the large transaction amount, all of which could lead to regulatory penalties if not addressed promptly.",0.028224839,0,

While the customer is a low‑risk individual with up‑to‑date KYC and no PEP status, the following red flags raise the risk level:

1. **Sanctions screening flagged as ""potential""** – this triggers a review under FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑02. Even though the EDD flag is set to false, the presence of a potential sanctions match indicates that the transaction may exceed the bank’s risk tolerance for high‑risk jurisdictions or products.
2. **Channel and jurisdiction** – Hong Kong is considered a higher‑risk jurisdiction for money‑laundering purposes. The use of an HK‑based FPS channel (FINMA‑RISK‑01 risk signal: new or increased exposure to high‑risk jurisdictions) adds to the inherent risk.
3. **Large transaction amount** – 1.8 m GBP is above typical thresholds for routine fund subscriptions. If the bank’s KRI for high‑risk client exposure is set below this amount, the KRI would be breached, triggering EDD under FINMA‑RISK‑02.
4. **VA exposure** – the product has value‑added (VA) exposure and disclosure was provided, but the presence of VA exposure can increase the complexity of the transaction and the potential for layering.
5. **Missing explicit documentation** – the risk analysis document, KRI dashboard, and board approval log are not provided in the transaction record. Under FINMA‑RISK‑04, the absence of these documents suggests that the transaction may not have been fully reviewed against the latest risk tolerance.

Given these factors, the transaction falls into the **Medium‑Risk** band (46‑65). It does not reach the high‑risk threshold (66‑85) because the customer’s risk rating is low, KYC is current, and EDD has been performed.

According to FINMA‑RISK‑02, exposure to a high‑risk jurisdiction or client segment that exceeds the defined tolerance must trigger Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).

3. **Beneficiary country/account mismatch** – The beneficiary account is a UK account (GB58KZON35689217938238) but the beneficiary country is listed as Germany (DE). This inconsistency is a typical indicator of data entry error or potential fraud, and is not covered by the existing documentation.

4. **Cash withdrawal of a large amount** – The transaction is a cash withdrawal of 117,516.31 CNY (~15,000 USD).

The transaction is a cash deposit (high‑risk product) of SGD 10,301.5, which is 44 % of the customer’s daily cash total (SGD 23,101.35).  Although it does not exceed a typical daily limit, the high cash‑deposit channel and the potential sanctions match push the KRI close to the tolerance threshold, warranting EDD.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – The exception process requires an EDD plan for any case that falls outside tolerance.  Because the sanctions screening is *potential* and the KYC is incomplete, the transaction should have been routed through the exception process with an EDD mitigation plan.  The absence of an exception request form and board approval indicates a procedural gap.

4. **Missing Documentation** – The transaction lacks a current KYC completion date, a sanctions‑screening result confirmation, and an EDD plan.  These omissions are critical controls that the regulatory framework mandates.

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – The high value (SGD 1.6 M) and the fact that the beneficiary is in Thailand (a high‑risk jurisdiction) likely push the exposure above the typical KRI threshold for high‑risk jurisdictions. Although EDD was performed, the KRI would have been triggered if the tolerance limit were lower, indicating a near‑violation.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The transaction involves a complex product (fund subscription) and a cross‑border channel (FPS via Hong Kong). The risk analysis must record these categories; the lack of explicit documentation in the provided data suggests the bank may not have fully documented the inherent risk for this specific combination, a minor gap.

3. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed in 2020 and was due in 2022, meaning the KYC is two years out of date. This is a significant compliance gap that could have triggered an EDD requirement under FINMA‑RISK‑02 if the bank’s policy mandates timely KYC updates.

4. **Cross‑border exposure** – The transaction is between a German originator and a Thai beneficiary, involving a foreign branch (FPS in Hong Kong). Under **FINMA‑RISK‑05**, a consolidated risk analysis for international operations should flag such cross‑border activity. The fact that EDD was performed indicates the bank recognized the risk, but the absence of a documented consolidated analysis in the data is a potential oversight.

5. **Missing documentation** – While EDD was performed, the data does not show a documented EDD plan or an exception request form, which would be required under **FINMA‑RISK‑03** if the transaction had exceeded tolerance limits. The absence of these documents suggests a minor procedural gap.

The required originator/beneficiary address and ID number are missing, violating the mandatory information requirement and triggering a potential STR.
3. **MAS-CDD-05** – The customer is classified as low risk, but the sanctions screening result is ""potential"" and cash ID verification is false. This contravenes the simplified CDD exception, which requires no suspicion of money laundering.
4. **Cash deposit size** – The daily cash total equals the transaction amount (HKD 77,546.03 ≈ SGD 10,000), a high cash‑deposit volume that is atypical for a low‑risk individual and raises concerns under ongoing monitoring rules.
5. **Missing documentation** – No address or ID number for either party, no BICs, and no proof of source of funds, all of which are required for high‑risk or cross‑border transactions.
Given these multiple violations and the presence of high‑risk indicators (sanctions, high‑risk jurisdiction, missing ID, large cash deposit), the transaction falls into the ""Very High Risk"" category, warranting a score of 92.",0.011368406,0,

1. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 4/11/2020 and was due on 3/5/2021, making it overdue by more than four years. FINMA‑RISK‑01 requires that risk analysis documents include up‑to‑date KYC data; an overdue KYC is a clear gap. 

2. **Sanctions screening ‘potential’** – The screening result indicates a potential sanctions match. Under FINMA‑RISK‑02, any high‑risk jurisdiction or client segment that triggers a key risk indicator (KRI) must trigger EDD. The transaction is flagged as potential, yet the system records ""edd_required"": false, which contradicts the rule that a sanctions match should trigger EDD. This inconsistency suggests a compliance gap. 

3. **EDD performed but not required** – The transaction shows ""edd_performed"": true while ""edd_required"": false. This indicates that the institution performed EDD on a transaction that was not flagged as high risk, or conversely that it failed to perform EDD on a transaction that should have been flagged. Either scenario reflects a deviation from FINMA‑RISK‑02 and FINMA‑RISK‑03 requirements. 

4. **Large transaction amount** – The value of 2,250,906.92 HKD (~280,000 USD) is significant for a single FX conversion. While not automatically high risk, it approaches the upper end of typical thresholds for domestic companies and could trigger a KRI under FINMA‑RISK‑02 if the institution’s tolerance limits are lower. 

Given these gaps—especially the KYC overdue status and the sanctions potential mismatch—the transaction falls into the **Medium Risk** band (46‑65).

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The risk analysis must record all risk categories. This transaction involves a cross‑border transfer from the UAE to Iran, a high‑risk jurisdiction, and a cash withdrawal, all of which are high‑risk categories that should be flagged in the risk analysis. The presence of a ""potential"" sanctions screening result indicates that the transaction is not fully compliant with the required sanctions checks.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – Key risk indicators (KRIs) for high‑risk client segments and jurisdictions must be monitored. The beneficiary country (IR) is a high‑risk jurisdiction; the transaction is a cash withdrawal, which is inherently high risk. The KRI for cross‑border cash withdrawals to high‑risk jurisdictions would likely be exceeded, triggering the requirement for enhanced due diligence (EDD). Although the system shows ""edd_required"": false, EDD was performed, suggesting a possible oversight in the KRI logic or documentation.

3. **Sanctions screening** – The transaction is flagged as ""potential"" under sanctions screening. Under FINMA, any potential sanctions violation requires EDD and further investigation. The fact that the transaction is still processed without a clear suspicion determination indicates a red flag.

4. **Cross‑border exposure** – The transaction involves a beneficiary in Iran, a country subject to strict sanctions. This alone elevates the risk profile, especially when combined with a cash withdrawal channel.

5. **Documentation gaps** – While EDD was performed, the system indicates that no EDD was required, which may reflect a documentation or policy compliance gap. The transaction also lacks a clear suspicion determination or follow‑up action, which is a compliance shortfall.

2. **HKMA‑R‑009** – The transaction exceeds the HK$8,000 threshold for wire transfers (and is well above the HK$120,000 threshold for occasional transactions). CDD is required, and the lack of source‑of‑funds documentation is a violation.

4. **Incomplete SWIFT fields** – The SWIFT message lacks purpose (swift_f70_purpose) and charges (swift_f71_charges) information, which are required for compliance under **MAS‑WIRE‑01** and general CDD requirements. This omission could be considered a breach of record‑keeping and due‑diligence obligations.
5. **Mismatch between originator country and account country** – The originator is listed as French (FR) but the account is a UK account (GB). This inconsistency raises concerns about the true source of funds and may indicate a structuring attempt.

While the amount is below typical high‑risk thresholds, several red flags raise the risk level:

1. **High‑risk client domicile** – Originator country ID triggers a higher inherent risk under FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑02. The bank must apply enhanced due diligence (EDD) for such clients.
2. **Sanctions screening flagged as ""potential""** – This indicates a possible match with a sanctions list, a key risk indicator that should trigger EDD under FINMA‑RISK‑01.
3. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 19/7/2022 and was due on 19/7/2023, meaning the KYC is now out‑of‑date. This violates the requirement to keep KYC data current and increases the risk of non‑compliance.
4. **Cash ID not verified** – The transaction is a cash deposit but the cash ID was not verified, which is a missing control for cash‑related transactions.
5. **EDD performed but not required** – The system indicates EDD was performed even though the rule states EDD is required only when a KRI exceeds tolerance. This suggests a potential procedural mismatch.

1. **Cross‑border to a high‑risk jurisdiction (Thailand)** – The beneficiary country is TH, which is classified as a high‑risk jurisdiction for money‑laundering and terrorist financing. Under FINMA‑RISK‑01 the risk analysis must flag such geography, and FINMA‑RISK‑05 requires a consolidated risk analysis for cross‑border activity. This alone pushes the risk above the 66‑85% threshold.

2. **Cash withdrawal** – Cash transactions are inherently high‑risk. FINMA‑RISK‑01 lists product/service as a risk category; cash withdrawals are typically considered high‑risk, especially when combined with cross‑border movement.

3. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 7/1/2020 and was due on 6/1/2021, meaning the KYC is now overdue. FINMA‑RISK‑01 requires that all risk categories be recorded and monitored; an overdue KYC is a clear gap in compliance.

4. **Sanctions screening flagged as ""potential""** – The sanctions check returned a potential match. FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑05 both require that any potential sanctions match trigger enhanced due diligence (EDD). Although EDD was performed, the fact that the screening flagged a potential match indicates a higher risk posture.

5. **No explicit EDD requirement flagged** – The transaction data shows `edd_required: false` but `edd_performed: true`. This mismatch suggests that the system may have applied EDD without a formal trigger, indicating a procedural gap.

6. **Missing documentation** – The transaction lacks a documented exception request or board approval, which would be required under FINMA‑RISK‑03 if the transaction exceeded tolerance limits.

Given these factors—high‑risk jurisdiction, cash product, overdue KYC, potential sanctions match, and procedural gaps—the transaction falls squarely in the **High Risk (66‑85)** band, warranting a risk score of 80. This score reflects the likelihood of regulatory non‑compliance and the need for immediate remedial action.

While the record indicates EDD was performed, the required documentation (ID card, passport, proof of address, beneficial owner details, risk assessment, senior‑management approval) is not confirmed in the transaction data. 

2. **MAS-WIRE-01** – The rule mandates full originator and beneficiary details: name, account number, address, and ID number. The transaction only provides name, account number, and country; address and ID number are missing, and the travel‑rule flag is set to false. This constitutes a non‑compliance with the mandatory wire‑transfer information requirement. 

3. **MAS-WIRE-02** – Because the required originator/beneficiary information is incomplete, the rule requires the transfer to be rejected, suspended, or investigated, and an STR filed if suspicious. No STR has been filed (str_filed_datetime is null), indicating a direct violation. 

4. **MAS-STR-01** – The transaction is large, cross‑border, and flagged as a potential sanctions hit. Under MAS‑STR‑01, a suspicious transaction report must be filed regardless of amount. The absence of an STR is a clear breach. 

5. **Sanctions screening** – The screening result is ""potential,"" which is a red flag that the originator or beneficiary may be on a sanctions list. This alone warrants heightened scrutiny and likely an STR. 

6. **Risk rating mismatch** – The customer is rated ""High"" risk, yet the client risk profile is listed as ""Low"". This inconsistency suggests incomplete or inaccurate risk assessment.

1. **Out‑of‑date KYC** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 17/9/2021 and was due on 16/3/2022, well past the required review period. This violates **HKMA‑R‑007** (mandatory CDD) and represents a 50‑plus‑percent breach of the KYC renewal threshold.
2. **Missing Beneficial Owner Information** – For a corporate customer, the beneficial owners are not documented, breaching **HKMA‑R‑008**. This omission is a critical compliance gap.
3. **Suspicious Purpose Statement** – The SWIFT F70 field states ""Drug during image hot law,"" which is inconsistent with the purpose code SAL (salary) and the narrative. This triggers **AML‑SUS‑04** (flagging of suspicious transactions) and suggests potential money‑laundering activity.
4. **Incomplete Wire‑Transfer Data** – While the F50 and F59 fields are present, the originator’s identification number or date of birth is missing, violating **MAS‑WIRE‑01** which requires full originator identification for transfers above HK$8,000.
5. **Large Transaction Value** – At €244,284.41 (~HK$1.8 M), the transfer exceeds the HK$120,000 threshold in **HKMA‑R‑009**. Although EDD was performed, the overdue KYC and missing data undermine the adequacy of that due diligence.
6. **STR Filed** – The transaction was flagged as suspicious and an STR was filed two days later, confirming that the institution recognized the risk but the underlying compliance gaps remain.

• **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The institution must maintain a written risk analysis covering client domicile, product, geography, etc. The transaction involves a cross‑border securities trade (originator AU, beneficiary GB, channel FAST (SG)), a high‑risk jurisdiction for the originator and a fast‑settlement channel, which would normally be flagged in the risk analysis. 

• **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – The client is a PEP with a high risk profile and sanctions screening returned ""potential"". These factors would likely exceed the bank’s predefined tolerance limits for PEPs and sanctions‑red‑flagged entities, triggering a KRI. The fact that EDD is required and has been performed satisfies the rule’s requirement that EDD be triggered when a KRI is breached. 

• **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – No exception request is needed because EDD has been performed; however, the presence of a PEP and sanctions potential would normally require an exception approval if the transaction had not been covered by EDD. 

• **FINMA‑RISK‑05** – The transaction is cross‑border and involves an international branch (FAST (SG)). A consolidated risk analysis at the group level would need to capture this exposure. The fact that the transaction is flagged for sanctions potential indicates that the consolidated analysis would have identified a high‑risk activity, which is consistent with the requirement to trigger EDD. 

Key gaps that elevate the score: 
1. **KYC overdue** – The KYC due date (27/5/2024) has passed, which is a red flag under FINMA‑RISK‑01 and may increase the inherent risk. 
2. **Sanctions screening “potential”** – This is a pending red flag that has not yet been resolved, raising the risk level. 
3. **Fast‑settlement channel** – FAST (SG) is a high‑speed channel that can increase the risk of money‑laundering if not properly monitored. 

Because the transaction is not fully compliant with all best‑practice controls (KYC overdue, sanctions potential) but has mitigated risk through EDD, the overall risk is moderate. The score of 65 reflects a 70–85% threshold of the risk tolerance band, with some minor gaps but no outright rule violations.}",0.021239614,0,

Overall, the combination of an expired KYC, potential sanctions, high transaction value, and inconsistent risk assessment places the transaction in the high‑risk band (66‑85).",0.013035874,0,

However, the originator is from Iran, a FATF‑listed high‑risk jurisdiction, which under MAS‑CDD‑04 mandates Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).

A key compliance gap is the absence of documented beneficial owner information for the domiciliary company (MAS‑CDD‑02).

While the amount is modest and the bank has performed EDD and documented a statement of work, several red flags remain:

1. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 08/03/2021 and was due on 08/03/2022, meaning the KYC is now two years out of date. This violates the implicit requirement that KYC data be current for risk assessment (FINMA‑RISK‑01).
2. **High‑risk jurisdiction exposure** – Thailand is typically classified as a high‑risk jurisdiction for AML. The transaction falls under the risk category “client domicile” and would trigger a KRI under FINMA‑RISK‑02 if the bank’s tolerance for high‑risk jurisdiction transactions is set below the transaction amount.
3. **Cash transaction** – Cash withdrawals are inherently high‑risk. Even though the amount is below many banks’ typical cash‑withdrawal thresholds, the combination of cash, high‑risk origin, and overdue KYC elevates the risk.
4. **Missing documentation** – The transaction record does not include a KRI dashboard snapshot or a board approval log for the risk tolerance limits that would confirm compliance with FINMA‑RISK‑02.

Given these factors, the transaction does not violate any FINMA rule outright but exhibits minor gaps that warrant monitoring. The risk score of 35 falls within the ""Low Risk"" band (26‑45) as the transaction is still within the bank’s tolerance limits and no key documentation is missing beyond the overdue KYC.

1. **Sanctions screening flagged as ""potential""** – This indicates a possible match to a sanctions list, which is a key risk signal under FINMA‑RISK‑01 (risk categories: client domicile, geography). A potential sanctions match typically triggers enhanced due diligence (EDD) and is a strong indicator of higher risk.

2. **High‑risk client profile vs. medium risk rating** – The customer is classified as a corporate client with a medium risk rating, yet the client risk profile is marked as ""High"". This inconsistency suggests that the internal risk assessment may not be fully aligned with the regulatory risk tolerance framework (FINMA‑RISK‑02). The mismatch raises concerns about the adequacy of the risk tolerance limits and KRIs.

3. **Originator from Indonesia (high‑risk jurisdiction) and beneficiary in Hong Kong** – Both jurisdictions are considered high‑risk under FINMA guidelines. The transaction therefore falls into a high‑risk category that should be monitored closely and potentially trigger EDD (FINMA‑RISK‑02, FINMA‑RISK‑03).

4. **EDD performed but not required** – The transaction record shows ""edd_required"": false but ""edd_performed"": true. While performing EDD when not required is not a violation, it indicates a possible procedural inconsistency or over‑cautious approach that may reflect underlying uncertainty about the transaction’s risk.

5. **No evidence of an exception request** – If the transaction had exceeded the defined risk tolerance, an exception process (FINMA‑RISK‑03) would need to be documented. The absence of an exception request form or board approval log suggests that the transaction may have been processed without the formal exception approval that would be required for a high‑risk case.

6. **KYC due date approaching** – The KYC was last completed on 11/03/2023 and is due on 10/03/2024. While still within the due date, the proximity to renewal and the high‑risk nature of the transaction add to the overall risk assessment.

Given these factors, the transaction sits in the **High‑Risk** band (66‑85). The presence of a potential sanctions match and high‑risk jurisdictions, combined with inconsistencies in risk rating and EDD application, justify a score of 75 out of 100.

The customer is a corporate entity with a low risk rating, but the cash channel itself elevates the risk profile.

2. **Potential sanctions screening flag** – The sanctions screening result is ""potential"", indicating that the originator or beneficiary may be on a sanctions list or have a suspicious connection.

3. **KYC overdue** – The KYC was last completed on 30/6/2022 and was due on 30/6/2023, meaning the customer’s KYC is now overdue. FINMA‑RISK‑01 requires that risk analysis documents record data sources such as KYC completion dates; an overdue KYC is a risk signal that the customer’s profile may have changed.

4. **Cross‑border nature** – The originator is from Singapore (SG) and the beneficiary from Australia (AU). While neither jurisdiction is classified as high‑risk by FINMA, the cross‑border element combined with a cash withdrawal increases the likelihood of illicit activity.

5. **Missing documentation** – The transaction lacks a documented KRI dashboard for this specific cash withdrawal, and there is no evidence of a board‑approved exception or EDD plan for a potential sanctions case. According to FINMA‑RISK‑03, any transaction that falls outside tolerance must have an exception request and EDD plan documented.

Given these factors, the transaction falls into the **High Risk** band (66‑85). The presence of a sanctions flag, overdue KYC, and a high‑risk channel (cash) justify a score of 75, reflecting significant risk but not yet at the very high level where multiple rule violations or severe red flags would push the score above 85.",0.043406766,0,

1. **KYC overdue** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 18/03/2022 and was due on 17/03/2024, yet the transaction occurred on 24/07/2024. This violates the ongoing‑monitoring requirement under **AML-CDD-01** and **HKMA‑R‑009** (CDD must be performed for any transaction above HK$8,000). The overdue KYC indicates a lapse in maintaining up‑to‑date customer information.

2. **Sanctions screening flagged “potential”** – The transaction is marked as a potential sanctions case. Under **MAS‑EDD‑01** (and the broader HKMA‑R‑010 for PEP/high‑risk customers), any customer or counterparty that triggers sanctions or is a suspected money‑laundering suspect requires Enhanced Due Diligence. Although EDD was performed, the system indicates it was not required, suggesting a mismatch between the sanctions flag and the EDD trigger.

3. **No Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) filed** – The transaction meets the threshold for a wire‑type transfer (HK$11,800 > HK$8,000) and has a potential sanctions flag. **AML‑SUS‑04** mandates that any suspicious or high‑risk transaction be investigated and an STR filed. The absence of an STR (str_filed_datetime is null) is a direct regulatory breach.

4. **Beneficial ownership not explicitly verified** – The customer is a domiciliary company. **HKMA‑R‑008** requires that the institution identify and verify the beneficial owners of any legal person or trust. The transaction record does not show a beneficial‑owner declaration, raising a compliance gap.

5. **Other minor gaps** – The swift F70 (purpose) and F71 (charges) fields are null, though not explicitly required for FAST payments, they are typically expected for full compliance. The transaction also has a low client risk profile, but the combination of overdue KYC, sanctions flag, missing STR, and potential missing beneficial‑owner data pushes the risk into the high‑risk band.

Given these multiple overlapping red flags, the transaction is assessed at a **high risk (score 80)**, indicating that it is close to violating several regulatory rules and requires immediate remedial action.

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The originator is from Thailand, a jurisdiction typically classified as high‑risk for money laundering. The risk analysis should have flagged this category and triggered enhanced due diligence (EDD). The transaction shows `edd_required: false` yet `edd_performed: true`, indicating a mismatch between the risk assessment and the required controls.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – The institution’s risk tolerance for high‑risk jurisdictions is likely breached by a 20 000 CHF cash deposit from a Thai originator. The KRI for high‑risk client exposure should have triggered EDD, but the system did not flag it as required. This constitutes a violation of the rule that mandates EDD when a KRI exceeds tolerance.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – No exception request or board approval is documented for this high‑risk transaction. The absence of an exception process for a transaction that potentially breaches tolerance is a regulatory gap.

4. **KYC and Verification Gaps** – The customer’s KYC was last completed in December 2020 and was due in June 2021, meaning the KYC is overdue by more than three years. Additionally, `cash_id_verified` is false, so the cash deposit was not verified. Both are significant compliance failures.

5. **Product Complexity and Suspicion** – The transaction is marked as `product_complex: true` and was flagged as suspicious (`suspicion_determined_datetime`). A suspicious transaction report was filed, but the underlying controls (EDD, KYC, cash ID verification) were inadequate.

6. **Cross‑border Nature** – The transaction involves a Thai originator and a German beneficiary, making it a cross‑border activity. Under **FINMA‑RISK‑05**, a consolidated risk analysis should capture such activity, and any high‑risk cross‑border exposure should trigger EDD.

FINMA‑RISK‑02 requires that high‑risk jurisdictions trigger key risk indicators (KRIs) and, if thresholds are exceeded, EDD must be triggered; the lack of an explicit KRI trigger for this transaction suggests a potential tolerance breach. FINMA‑RISK‑03 mandates an exception process for high‑risk client relationships that fall outside tolerance limits; no exception request or board approval is documented for this transaction. Additionally, the sanctions screening result is ""potential"", and the KYC was overdue (last completed 2019, due 2020), both of which are red flags under FINMA regulations.

- **MAS-WIRE-01**: Full originator and beneficiary details are required. The absence of BICs and incomplete travel‑rule information violate the requirement for detailed originator/beneficiary data.

The originator is from Russia, a high‑risk jurisdiction, which triggers EDD – this has been carried out. The transaction amount (462,348 SGD) exceeds the 120,000 SGD threshold for large transfers, so the CDD/EDD requirements were met.

However, the sanctions screening result is ""potential"", indicating a possible sanctions risk that has not yet been resolved or investigated. This is a red flag under the general AML/CFT framework (e.g., AML‑SUS‑04) and warrants further scrutiny. Additionally, the customer’s KYC was last completed in December 2021 with a due date of December 2022, meaning the KYC is still technically current but close to expiry, which could raise concerns if not refreshed promptly.

No STR has been filed and no other regulatory breaches (e.g., missing stored‑value records, VA exposure, or non‑compliance with licensing rules) are evident.

1. **Risk Category – Geography & Product (FINMA‑RISK‑01)**: The beneficiary country is listed as Vietnam, a jurisdiction that is typically classified as high‑risk for AML/CFT. The product is a cash deposit, which is inherently high risk. These categories should have been flagged in the bank’s written risk analysis and would normally trigger Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). 

2. **Risk Category – Client Profile (FINMA‑RISK‑02)**: The customer’s risk profile is marked as ""High"" while the risk rating is ""Low"", indicating a mismatch that suggests incomplete or outdated risk assessment. The KYC was last completed on 5/5/2020 and was due on 5/5/2022, meaning the KYC is now three years overdue – a clear red flag that the bank’s risk tolerance limits may have been breached. 

3. **Daily Cash Exposure**: The customer’s daily cash total is CHF 25,272.98 with five cash transactions, averaging over CHF 5,000 per transaction. If the bank’s KRI for daily cash exposure is set below this level (typical thresholds are 10‑15k for high‑risk clients), the KRI would be exceeded, triggering an exception process (FINMA‑RISK‑03). No evidence of an exception approval or board‑level review is provided. 

4. **EDD Status**: The transaction record shows ""edd_required"": false but ""edd_performed"": true. While EDD was performed, the fact that it was not required according to the bank’s own risk assessment suggests a potential gap in the risk tolerance framework. According to FINMA‑RISK‑02, if a KRI indicates exposure above tolerance, EDD must be triggered; the bank’s internal logic appears inconsistent. 

5. **Documentation & Controls**: The transaction includes SWIFT F50 and F59 messages, yet the channel is listed as ""Cash"" – an inconsistency that may indicate incomplete or incorrect documentation. The travel rule is marked complete, but travel rule applicability is generally for electronic transfers, not cash deposits. 

6. **Overall Assessment**: The transaction does not outright violate any FINMA rule, but it sits at the upper end of the medium‑risk band (46‑65) due to the combination of high‑risk jurisdiction, high‑risk product, overdue KYC, mismatched risk rating, and potential KRI breach. The bank’s risk tolerance framework appears to have gaps that could lead to a violation if not addressed. Hence a risk score of 60 is assigned.",0.00028613844,0,

While the amount is moderate and the product (cash deposit) is low‑risk, several red flags raise the risk level. 

1. **KYC Expiry** – The customer’s KYC was last completed on 12/07/2021 and was due on 12/07/2022, meaning the KYC is now two years out‑of‑date. Under FINMA‑RISK‑01 the institution must record and monitor such gaps; the lack of a current KYC record is a compliance gap that increases risk.

2. **Potential Sanctions Match** – The sanctions screening returned a ""potential"" match. Even though no suspicion was determined yet, a potential match triggers the need for enhanced due diligence (EDD) under FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑02. The transaction lists ""edd_required"": false, yet ""edd_performed"": true, indicating that the EDD was performed but the system did not flag the transaction as requiring it. This inconsistency is a regulatory shortfall.

3. **Cross‑border Nature** – The beneficiary is in Singapore, a jurisdiction that is not classified as high‑risk but still requires monitoring under FINMA‑RISK‑05 for international branches. The transaction is therefore subject to the consolidated risk analysis and KRI monitoring for cross‑border activity.

4. **Other Controls** – The transaction satisfies travel‑rule compliance, has the required SWIFT fields (F50, F59, F70), and the purpose code is legitimate. No PEP status, low customer risk rating, and no product complexity mitigate the risk.

Balancing the moderate amount, low inherent risk product, and the identified compliance gaps (KYC expiry and potential sanctions match) places the transaction in the **Medium‑Risk** band (46‑65). A score of 55 reflects the presence of minor but significant red flags without reaching the threshold for high or very high risk.

2. **AML-CDD-01** – The institution must collect and verify the identity of every customer, source of funds, and purpose before providing a service. The transaction lacks any evidence of ID documents or source‑of‑funds documentation; only a customer ID is present.
3. **Missing suitability assessment** – ""suitability_assessed"" is false and ""suitability_result"" is recorded as ""match"" without an assessment. Suitability is a required step for a complex securities trade.
4. **KYC overdue** – The last KYC completion date (10/12/2020) is past the due date (10/12/2022). An overdue KYC is a red flag under HKMA-R-009 and AML-CDD-01.
5. **Incomplete SWIFT fields** – ""swift_f70_purpose"" is null despite the presence of a purpose code (MED). While not a hard violation, it indicates incomplete transaction documentation.
6. **Large transaction amount** – USD 348,096.46 (~HK$2.7M) far exceeds the HK$8,000 threshold, amplifying the importance of the above due‑diligence steps.

These gaps represent significant compliance failures, placing the transaction in the **High Risk (66‑85)** band.

3. **Out‑of‑date KYC (FINMA‑RISK‑02 & FINMA‑RISK‑03)** – KYC was last completed in December 2021 and was due in December 2022, meaning the KYC is now overdue. An overdue KYC is a key risk indicator that should prompt EDD or an exception process.

4. **EDD performed but not required (FINMA‑RISK‑03)** – The system indicates that EDD was performed even though the transaction was not flagged as requiring it. This suggests a potential procedural gap or mis‑classification of risk.

5. **Cross‑border SWIFT transfer with FX component (FINMA‑RISK‑01)** – The transaction involves foreign exchange (JPY/HKD) and a cross‑border SWIFT transfer, both of which are higher‑inherent‑risk activities that should be monitored closely.

6. **Missing documentation for exception process (FINMA‑RISK‑03)** – No exception request form or board approval is documented for this high‑risk client, which is a procedural shortfall.

Given these factors, the transaction does not violate any rule outright but presents multiple minor gaps and red‑flags that warrant a medium‑risk assessment (score 55).",0.0046245,0,

1. **KYC overdue** – The KYC was last completed on 22/03/2020 and was due on 18/09/2020, meaning the customer’s profile has not been updated for over four years. This violates the ongoing due‑diligence requirement implicit in FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑02.
2. **Sanctions screening “potential”** – The screening flagged a potential sanctions match. Under FINMA‑RISK‑05, any high‑risk cross‑border activity that triggers a sanctions alert must trigger EDD. Although the customer is low risk, the potential sanctions match is a significant red flag.
3. **Missing BICs** – The ordering and beneficiary institution BICs are null, which may hinder full transaction traceability and could be considered a documentation gap.
4. **No explicit EDD trigger** – The system indicates EDD was performed, but the transaction does not meet the explicit EDD trigger criteria in FINMA‑RISK‑02 (high‑risk jurisdiction or client segment). The EDD performed appears to be a precautionary measure rather than a regulatory requirement.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑02** – High‑risk jurisdictions and large amounts typically exceed the quantitative limits set for such categories. The KYC for the customer is overdue (due date 13/5/2022), indicating that the risk tolerance for this client is not being monitored properly. The KRI dashboard would likely show a breach of tolerance for high‑risk client exposure.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – An exception process is required for any transaction that breaches tolerance. The transaction was processed without a documented exception request or board approval, and the EDD was performed even though the system flagged it as not required. This indicates a failure to follow the exception workflow.

4. **FINMA‑RISK‑05** – The transaction is cross‑border (GB‑IR) and involves a high‑risk jurisdiction. The consolidated risk analysis at the group level must capture such exposures and trigger EDD.

1. **FINMA‑RISK‑01** – The bank’s written risk analysis must flag any high‑risk jurisdiction or client segment.

The client’s risk profile is marked as ""High"" while the KYC rating is ""Low"" and the KYC completion date is set to 3/1/2025, which is in the future relative to the transaction date (2024‑01‑05). This indicates that the required KYC data was not available at the time of the transaction, violating the obligation to record and analyze all risk categories.

The KYC and EDD status are inconsistent: EDD is marked as performed but not required, and the client risk rating is low while the risk profile is high. This mismatch suggests that the KRI monitoring system failed to trigger an EDD when the exposure exceeded tolerance thresholds.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03** – No exception request or board approval is documented for this high‑risk transaction. The absence of an exception process, despite the transaction falling outside the defined risk tolerance, is a direct violation of the rule.

This inconsistency triggers a KRI violation, as the rule mandates that any high‑risk exposure above tolerance must trigger EDD.

2. **FINMA‑RISK‑01 (Risk Analysis Documentation)** – No evidence of a written risk analysis is provided for this transaction. The rule requires a documented risk analysis covering client domicile, segment, product, and geography. The absence of this documentation is a direct non‑compliance.

3. **FINMA‑RISK‑03 (Exception Process)** – The client’s high risk profile would normally require an exception request if it falls outside the defined tolerance. No exception request form, board approval, or mitigation plan is documented, violating the exception process requirement.

4. **FINMA‑RISK‑04 (Periodic Review)** – The KYC last completed date is 15/1/2025, which is in the future relative to the transaction date (20/3/2024). This indicates that the KYC was not up‑to‑date at the time of the transaction, violating the requirement for periodic review and board approval of the risk analysis.

5. **Cross‑border nature** – The transaction involves accounts in the UK (GB) but originates and benefits from Hong Kong (HK) clients. According to FINMA‑RISK‑05, a consolidated risk analysis for international branches should capture such cross‑border activity. No group‑level KRI dashboard or consolidated analysis is referenced.

Given these multiple rule violations and documentation gaps, the transaction falls into the ""High Risk"" band (66‑85).

• **HKMA‑R‑010** – Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is mandatory for customers from high‑risk jurisdictions. The system records that EDD was performed, but the rule requires that EDD be *required*; the fact that the system flagged it as not required is a procedural inconsistency.
• **AML‑SUS‑04** – Transactions involving high‑risk jurisdictions must be flagged and investigated. The originator’s country (IR) satisfies this trigger.
• **AML‑EDD‑03** – Although the customer is an individual, the high‑risk jurisdiction and the cash nature of the transaction still fall under the broader EDD regime for DNFBPs and high‑risk activities.

The transaction does not breach any monetary thresholds (e.g., the HK$120,000 cash‑transaction reporting threshold or the HK$8,000 wire‑transfer threshold) and there is no evidence of structuring or rapid movement of funds.

3. **Large transaction amount** – CHF 1,094,134.2 is a substantial sum for a fund subscription. Without explicit evidence that the bank’s risk tolerance for medium‑risk clients allows such a volume, the transaction may exceed the limits set in FINMA‑RISK‑02, triggering a KRI breach.
4. **EDD performed but not required** – The system flags EDD as performed even though the risk rating is only Medium. This inconsistency suggests a gap in the bank’s exception process (FINMA‑RISK‑03) and may indicate that the transaction was not properly evaluated against the risk tolerance.
5. **Product complexity** – The transaction is marked as product_complex=true, which increases inherent risk and should have prompted enhanced due diligence per FINMA‑RISK‑01.

1. **Client risk profile** – The customer is classified as ""High"" risk, yet the transaction record indicates that EDD was not required (edd_required: false) but was performed (edd_performed: true). Under FINMA‑RISK‑02, a high‑risk client that exceeds the defined tolerance must trigger EDD; the mismatch suggests a control gap. 

2. **KYC overdue** – The KYC was last completed on 24/05/2022 and was due on 24/05/2023, meaning the customer’s KYC is now overdue. FINMA‑RISK‑01 requires that all risk categories be monitored and that any category exceeding tolerance triggers EDD. An overdue KYC is a clear indicator that the risk assessment is not up‑to‑date. 

3. **Large cross‑border FX transaction** – The amount of 991,924.24 USD is substantial for a single FX conversion. While the product is not inherently high risk, the combination of a large amount, cross‑border nature (DE → GB), and a high‑risk client profile elevates the inherent risk. FINMA‑RISK‑01 and FINMA‑RISK‑02 require that such exposures be monitored via KRIs; the absence of any documented KRI dashboard or evidence of monitoring raises concern. 

4. **Missing documentation** – The transaction record does not reference a risk tolerance statement, KRI dashboard, or board approval log. These are required under FINMA‑RISK‑02 and FINMA‑RISK‑04. The lack of these documents indicates that the institution may not have formally documented its risk tolerance or monitored compliance. 

5. **Potentially suspicious narrative** – The narrative ""Use after art business tend director whom produce network magazine"" is vague and could be indicative of a complex or opaque transaction structure. While not a definitive red flag, it adds to the overall risk profile. 

Given these factors, the transaction falls into the ""High Risk"" band (66‑85) according to the scoring guidelines. The primary drivers are the high client risk profile, overdue KYC, mismatch in EDD requirement, and missing key documentation and monitoring controls.",0.006086262,0,
