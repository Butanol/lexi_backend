decisions; and
	
(ii)	
a statement that the person may apply to the

(4)	
A decision to exercise a Subdivision 2 power in relation to a 
person takes effect at the time the person receives the notice 
given in respect of the decision or at the time specified in the 
notice, whichever is the later.
	
(5)	
If—
	
(a)	
the Commission decides to exercise a Subdivision 2 
power in relation to a person (intervention subject); and
Part 5B—Division 9	
5B-168
Section 53ZTC

(b)	
the reasons provided in accordance with subsection (2) 
or (3) relate specifically to matters that—
	
(i)	
refer to any person (identified person) who is 
identified in the statement of the reasons for the 
decision but who is not the intervention subject; 
and
	
(ii)	
are, in the opinion of the Commission, prejudicial 
to the identified person in any respect,
the Commission must, as soon as reasonably practicable 
after the decision, take all reasonable steps to serve on the 
identified person a copy of the notice given in respect of the 
decision.
	
(6)	
Subsections (2), (3) and (5) do not require a notice, or a 
copy of a notice, given in respect of a decision to exercise 
a Subdivision 2 power to be served on any person if the 
notice or copy has been served on the person under any other 
provision of this Part.
	
(7)	
The Commission must publish in the Gazette, and may 
publish by any additional means that it considers appropriate, 
a notice regarding a decision to exercise a Subdivision 2 
power.
	
(8)	
A notice published under subsection (7) may, if the 
Commission considers appropriate, include a statement of the 
reasons for the decision to exercise a Subdivision 2 power to 
which the notice relates.
	
(9)	
A decision to exercise a Subdivision 2 power does not 
operate so as to render an agreement unenforceable by a party 
to the agreement if the party proves that in entering into the 
agreement the party—
	
(a)	
acted in good faith; and
Part 5B—Division 9	
5B-170
Section 53ZTC

(b)	
was unaware of any notice given, served or published 
under this Subdivision in respect of or regarding the 
decision to exercise the Subdivision 2 power.
	
(10)	
If, because of the application of this Subdivision or of 
the giving, service or publication of any notice under this 
Subdivision, a person rescinds an agreement, the person must 
restore to any other party to the agreement any money or 
other benefit received or obtained by the person under the 
agreement from that party.

at any time after the imposition takes effect, the licence 
of the licensed provider is revoked or suspended.

The revocation or suspension—
	
(a)	
does not affect the validity of the imposition of the 
Subdivision 2 prohibition or requirement that has taken 
effect; and
	
(b)	
without limiting paragraph (a), does not affect any 
power exercisable by the Commission under section 
53ZTB, at the time when the revocation or suspension 
takes effect or at any later time,
and a reference in this Part to a licensed provider is to be 
construed accordingly.

respect of, or with reference to, the licensed provider or

revocation or suspension) is in force.
	
(5)	
The licensed provider does not contravene the prohibition in 
section 53ZRD(1) on carrying on a business of providing a 
VA service merely because it complies with the Subdivision 2 
prohibition or requirement.
	
(6)	
To avoid doubt, if the Commission has decided to revoke or 
suspend the licence of a licensed provider, the Commission 
may, at any time before the revocation or suspension takes 
effect, impose or withdraw a Subdivision 2 prohibition or 
requirement in respect of, or with reference, to the licensed 
provider or any of its associated entities.
	
(7)

entities where the licence of the licensed provider has been 
suspended.

modifications, to the amendments to the code or 
guideline as they apply to the code or guideline; and
	
(b)	
any reference in this or any other Ordinance to the code

construed as a reference to the code or guideline as

A failure on the part of a person to comply with a provision 
of any code or guideline published under this section does 
not by itself make the person liable to any legal proceedings, 
whether in the nature of judicial proceedings or otherwise.
	
(6)	
Despite subsection (5)—
	
(a)	
the codes or guidelines may be taken into account in 
considering, for the purposes of any provision of this

specified extent, in relation to any specified person 
or to members of a specified class of persons;
	
(ii)	
do not have effect in relation to any specified 
transaction or class of transactions entered into by 
any specified person or class of persons; or
	
(iii)	
are, where they require any application, statement, 
notice or other document (however described) 
to be lodged or filed with or submitted to the 
Commission, to be regarded as having been 
complied with if the application, statement, notice 
or other document (as the case requires) is lodged 
Part 5B—Division 10	
5B-194
Section 53ZTL

or filed with or submitted to any other specified 
person; and
	
(b)	
to prescribe any matter that under this Part is to be 
prescribed by rules.
	
(3)	
Except as otherwise provided in this Part, rules made by the 
Commission under this section—
	
(a)	
may be of general or special application and may be 
made so as to apply only in specified circumstances;
	
(b)	
may 
make 
different 
provisions 
for 
different 
circumstances and provide for different cases or classes 
of cases;
	
(c)	
may authorize any matter or thing to be determined, 
applied or regulated by any specified person;
	
(d)

evidential 
and 
consequential 
provisions 
(whether 
involving the provisions of any principal legislation or 
the provisions of any subsidiary legislation).
	
(4)	
Despite any other provisions of this Part but subject to 
subsection (6), if the Commission proposes to make rules 
under subsection (1), it must publish a draft of the proposed 
rules, in a manner that it considers appropriate, for the 
purpose of inviting representations on the proposed rules by 
the public.
	
(5)	
If the Commission makes any rules under subsection (1) after 
a draft is published under subsection (4) in relation to the 
rules, it must—
Part 5B—Division 10	
5B-196
Section 53ZTL

(a)	
publish, in a manner that it considers appropriate, an 
account setting out in general terms—
	
(i)	
the representations made on the draft; and
	
(ii)	
the 
response 
of 
the 
Commission 
to 
the 
representations; and
	
(b)	
if the rules are made with modifications that in the 
opinion of the Commission result in the rules being 
significantly different from the draft, publish, in a 
manner that it considers appropriate, details of the 
difference.
	
(6)	
Subsections (4) and (5) do not apply if the Commission 
considers, in the circumstances of the case, that—
	
(a)	
it is inappropriate or unnecessary that those subsections 
should apply; or
	
(b)	
any 
delay 
involved 
in 
complying 
with 
those 
subsections—
	
(i)	
would not be in the interest of the investing public; 
or
	
(ii)	
would not be in the public interest.
	
(7)	
To avoid doubt, subsections (4), (5) and (6) do not affect any 
other requirements that, apart from those subsections, apply 
to the making of any rules under any provision of this Part.
	
(8)	
If rules are made by the Commission under subsection (1), 
the Chief Executive in Council may make regulations to 
provide that a person who contravenes any specified provision 
of the rules that applies to the person commits an offence and 
is liable to a specified penalty not exceeding—
